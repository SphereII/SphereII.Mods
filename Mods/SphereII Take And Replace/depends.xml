<!--
	In V4 of the ModLauncher, a depends.xml can be read from a Modlet's folder,
	that is, in the same folder as ModInfo.xml, that can define other modlets that the
	ModLauncher will download automatically.
	
	Note: 
		This only applies to modlet's that the ModLauncher itself can download
		It does not support loading modlets from other sources, such as Nexus.
