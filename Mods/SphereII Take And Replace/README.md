Take And Replace Mod
====================

This mod, as configured by default, will allow the player to take the boards off of boarded up windows. Players will be able to peel off the boards on windows and storage crate boxes that typically need to be axed down, based on a timer. This timer is set by default to be 15 seconds, and is configurable through XML.
