FrankieCA_start,"[Frankie wipes sweat from his brow] Hot one today. Somethin' I can help you with, or just passin' by?"
FrankieCA_ask_crops,"Wondering how the farming's going?"
FrankieCA_ask_animals,"See much wildlife around here?"
ui_greetings_generic_just_passing_through,"Just passing through."
FrankieCA_crops_state,"It's a struggle, always is. Corn's comin' in okay this year, spuds too. But the blight hit the tomatoes hard last season. Always somethin'."
FrankieCA_resp_crops_blight,"Blight? That sounds bad."
FrankieCA_resp_crops_zeds,"Do the dead cause much trouble for the crops?"
FrankieCA_resp_ask_animals_cont,"See any animals lately?"
FrankieCA_crops_blight_details,"Bad? Wiped out nearly half the plants. Seems like fungi grow better than food these days. Gotta be careful what you plant, where you plant it."
FrankieCA_resp_ask_crops_again,"How are the crops otherwise?"
FrankieCA_crops_zed_issues,"They just stumble through, tramplin' everything. Don't eat 'em, thankfully, but they ruin enough just walkin'. Gotta keep fences strong."
FrankieCA_animals_state,"Wildlife? See deer sometimes, tasty but skittish. Heard wolves howlin' more often lately, though. Worryin'. Don't keep livestock no more, too much trouble protectin' 'em."
FrankieCA_resp_animals_wolves,"Wolves nearby?"
FrankieCA_resp_animals_livestock,"What happened to your livestock?"
FrankieCA_resp_ask_crops_cont,"How's the farming?"
FrankieCA_animals_wolf_details,"Aye, seem bolder than usual. Might be normal ones, might be... changed. Hard to tell from a distance. Don't like it either way. Keep my rifle close."
FrankieCA_resp_ask_animals_again,"Any other wildlife?"
FrankieCA_animals_livestock_loss,"Lost 'em early on. Chickens vanished, cow got taken by Zeds one night. Learned quick it was easier feedin' myself than tryin' to protect feed animals from everything else out here."
Frankie_done,"Alright. Keep your eyes peeled out there."
Frankie_resp_back_crops,"Anything else about the crops?"
Frankie_resp_back_animals,"Anything else about animals?"
