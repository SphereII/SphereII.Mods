ZL_start,"Anything specific on your mind about the undead?"
ZL_trigger_lore_talk,"Tell me about the undead."
ZL_types,"Types? Mostly the slow ones, the shamblers. Dangerous in groups. But sometimes... sometimes they move faster. Or make those awful guttural noises. Some crawl, too. Always gotta watch your feet."
ZL_ask_types,"What are the different kinds?"
ZL_ask_hunting,"How do you fight them?"
ZL_ask_avoidance,"How do you avoid them?"
ZL_ask_origin,"Where did they come from?"
ZL_resp_types_specials,"Are there 'special' types?"
ZL_resp_types_behavior,"How do they usually act?"
ZL_specials,"The 'special' ones? Stories abound. Radiated ones, screamers, big bloated ones... Seeing them seems more common near old city centers or maybe military sites. Best be extra careful in places like that."
ZL_resp_types_main,"What else about the types?"
ZL_behavior,"Main thing is, they're drawn to noise. And light, it seems. Sometimes they just stand there, twitchin'. Other times, they come runnin'. Doesn't seem to be much rhyme or reason. Best assume they're always dangerous."
ZL_hunting,"Dealing with 'em? Avoidance is best. Waste of resources otherwise. If you have to engage, distance is your friend - a rifle or bow. If they get close, something sturdy with good reach... aim for the head, always. Stops 'em cold."
ZL_resp_hunting_headshots,"Headshots are essential?"
ZL_resp_hunting_melee,"What about melee?"
ZL_headshots,"Yes, the head. Seems like the only sure way. Body shots just slow 'em down, sometimes not even that. Gotta destroy the brain, nasty as it is."
ZL_resp_hunting_main,"Any other combat advice?"
ZL_melee,"Something sturdy? Sledgehammers, spears, even a reinforced club or shovel. Good reach keeps them away from biting distance. Cracks skulls effectively. Better than getting close with just a knife."
ZL_avoidance,"Best way to deal with 'em is not to. Avoidance is key. Stay low, stay quiet. Move smart - don't cross open areas if you can help it, stick to cover. And avoid night travel if possible. That's their time."
ZL_resp_avoidance_noise,"Is noise a big factor?"
ZL_resp_avoidance_night,"Is night travel really that bad?"
ZL_noise,"Noise travels far, especially in the quiet. Gunshots, yelling, even loud footsteps or rattling gear... brings 'em investigating. Gotta learn to move quietly."
ZL_resp_avoidance_main,"What else about avoidance?"
ZL_night,"Night travel? Extremely risky. Visibility is low, but they seem to sense you just fine. They seem more active, maybe bolder. Best find a secure spot before dusk."
ZL_origin,"What made 'em? [Sighs] The million-dollar question. Heard everything. Weird space radiation, tainted water supplies, government bioweapons... maybe just a plague that got out of hand. Hard to know what to believe."
ZL_resp_origin_government,"Could the government be responsible?"
ZL_resp_origin_sickness,"Could it just be a disease?"
ZL_government,"The government theory? Plausible. They always had secret projects. Easy to imagine something escaping a lab, or being released intentionally, though that's dark to think about."
ZL_resp_origin_main,"Any other theories on the origin?"
ZL_sickness,"Just a hyper-aggressive virus, maybe? Like rabies or a mutated flu. Spreads quick, rewires the brain. Seems simple, but does it explain the ones that seem... different? Unnatural?"
ZL_done,"Watch yourself out there."
ZL_resp_back_to_start,"Got it. Ask something else?"
ZL_resp_back_to_lore,"Got it. Ask something about zombies?"
