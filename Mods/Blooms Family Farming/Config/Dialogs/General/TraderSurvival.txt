FrankieTS_start,"[Frankie leans on his hoe, looking tired] Sun's high. You need somethin'?"
FrankieTS_ask_traders,"See many traders come through?"
FrankieTS_ask_supplies,"How do you get supplies besides farming?"
FrankieTS_ask_survival,"Got any survival tips for this area?"
ui_greetings_generic_on_my_way,"Just heading out."
FrankieTS_traders_talk,"Traders? Once in a blue moon. That fella Joel used to pass by sometimes, Rekt too. Prices are high, and you never know who you're dealin' with these days. Mostly keep to myself."
FrankieTS_resp_traders_trust,"Don't trust them much?"
FrankieTS_resp_traders_need,"Must need supplies sometimes though?"
FrankieTS_resp_ask_supplies_cont,"How do you manage for supplies?"
FrankieTS_traders_distrust,"Trust? Trust is earned, not given freely no more. Seen too many friendly faces turn ugly when supplies get low. Rather rely on myself."
FrankieTS_resp_ask_traders_again,"Any specific traders?"
FrankieTS_traders_necessity,"Sure, need parts, ammo sometimes. Can't grow bullets. But I trade careful. Small amounts. Quick business. Don't linger."
FrankieTS_supplies_talk,"Supplies? Farm gives me food, water from the well if I boil it. Everything else... gotta scavenge. Quick runs to nearby places, always watchin' my back. Mostly lookin' for fuel, tools, maybe some shells for the shotgun."
FrankieTS_resp_supplies_scavenge,"Scavenging dangerous around here?"
FrankieTS_resp_supplies_needs,"What do you need most?"
FrankieTS_resp_ask_traders_cont,"Do traders help with supplies?"
FrankieTS_supplies_danger,"Always dangerous. Never know what's lurkin' behind a door. Gotta be quick, quiet, and ready to run. Only take what you absolutely need."
FrankieTS_resp_ask_supplies_again,"Where do you usually scavenge?"
FrankieTS_supplies_specifics,"Could always use more gas for the tiller, duct tape... always need tape. Shotgun shells are worth their weight in gold. But mostly, just try to make do with what I got."
FrankieTS_survival_talk,"Survival tips? Heh. Ain't no magic words. Keep your head on a swivel. Don't trust easily. And learn to fix things yourself. Nobody's comin' to save ya."
FrankieTS_resp_survival_fix,"Fixing things is important?"
FrankieTS_resp_survival_trust,"So you don't trust anyone?"
FrankieTS_resp_ask_survival_again,"Any other advice?"
FrankieTS_survival_fixing,"Damn right. Pump breaks, fence falls, roof leaks... gotta handle it. Can't run to the store no more. Knowin' how things work, how to patch 'em up... that's real survival skill."
FrankieTS_survival_trust_details,"Didn't say *anyone*. Said don't trust *easily*. Takes time. See how folks act when things get tight. That tells you who they really are. Most folks... they only look out for number one."
Frankie_done,"Alright. Keep your eyes peeled out there."
Frankie_resp_back_traders,"Anything else about traders?"
Frankie_resp_back_supplies,"Anything else about supplies?"
Frankie_resp_back_survival,"Anything else about surviving?"
Frankie_resp_back_to_start,"Return to Start"
