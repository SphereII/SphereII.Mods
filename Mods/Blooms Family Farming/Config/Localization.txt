Frankie_rain_talk,"[Nods slowly] Tell me about it. Crops are thirsty. A good downpour would be nice, 'long as it ain't that acid stuff some folks talk about further out. Just need honest rain."
Frankie_origin_talk,"Born and raised right here on this land. Farm's been in my family... well, longer than I can rightly remember. Pa taught me everything I know 'bout workin' the soil. Simpler times, then."
Frankie_since_apo_talk,"Mostly just this. [Gestures around the farm] Tryin' to keep the fences up, crops growin', and the dead... well, dead-er. Scavenge when I gotta. Lost my pa early on. Been just me and the dirt since."

Frankie_resp_accept_quest_1,"Alright, I'll handle it."
Frankie_quest_2_details,"Seed stocks are runnin' low. If you can find me some corn and potato seeds out there, and I've got some preserved food I can part with."
Frankie_resp_accept_quest_2,"I'll see what I can find."
Frankie_who_frankie,"Name's Frankie. This farm... it's all I got left. Just tryin' to make it day by day."
