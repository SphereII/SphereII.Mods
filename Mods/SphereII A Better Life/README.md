A Better Life
=============

A Better Life mod adds more life to your world by decorating the floor of the lakes and seas with terrain decorations and a variety of fish, including sardines, clownfish, sting rays, barracuda and turtles. New fish-based recipes generously supplied by Clockwork Orange has add a new element to our underwater exploration desires.

The skies were not ignored either; Enter and explore a world with a variety of flying birds, including seaguls, eagles and butterflies.
