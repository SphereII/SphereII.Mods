Inspired by the DAD Mod ( https://7daystodie.com/forums/showthread.php?68042-DadMod ), SDX brings you a truly clean UI experience.

Experience the game like never before in this immersive view, uncluttered by any UI indicators. It's you, your hands, and the world.

It's a heavily instrumented DLL mod that removes all the various UI indicators: Journal Tips, Loot Container messages, Health and Stamina bars. Even the tool belt has been removed.
