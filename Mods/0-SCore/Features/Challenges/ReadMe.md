The Challenges feature in SCore extends the game's existing challenge system, allowing modders to create new and custom
challenge objectives for players. This provides a flexible framework for designing diverse gameplay goals and rewarding
players upon their completion.

## How to Create a New SCore Challenge

To create a new custom challenge within the SCore framework, follow these steps:

1. **Add New Enum Entry**: Define a new entry for your challenge objective in the relevant Enum (likely
   `ChallengeTypeSCoreEnums.cs`).
2. **Update Harmony Patch**: Modify the Harmony Patch related to `ChallengeReadObjective` to ensure it correctly parses
   and recognizes your new enum entry.
3. **Add Challenge Objective Script**: Create a new C\# script file for your specific challenge objective within the
   `Scripts/ Challenge Objective` directory (e.g., inheriting from `ChallengeObjectiveSCoreBase.cs`).
4. **Implement Trigger (Optional)**: If your challenge requires a specific in-game action to trigger its progress, you
   may need to add a delegate, event, and corresponding Harmony patch. This can sometimes be included directly within
   the challenge objective script itself (e.g., as seen in `ChallengeObjectiveEnterPOI.cs`).

## Example Syntax

Challenges are defined in XML files (e.g., `challenges.xml`). Here's an example of the syntax for a custom SCore
challenge:

```xml

<challenge name="enterPOI" title_key="EnterPOI" icon="ui_game_symbol_wood" group="ScoreTest"
           short_description_key="challengeGathererWoodShort" description_key="challengeGathererWoodDesc"
           reward_text_key="challenge_reward_1000xp" reward_event="challenge_reward_1000">
    <objective type="EnterPOI, SCore" prefab="abandoned_house_02" count="10"/>
</challenge>
```

In this example:

* The `objective` tag specifies the custom challenge type (`type="EnterPOI, SCore"`) and its parameters (
  `prefab="abandoned_house_02"`, `count="10"`).

## Types of SCore Challenge Objectives

The Challenges feature includes various pre-defined custom objective types that modders can utilize:

* **`ChallengeObjectiveBigFire`**: Complete a challenge related to large fires.
* **`ChallengeObjectiveBlockDestroyed`**: Destroy a specific number or type of blocks.
* **`ChallengeObjectiveBlockDestroyedByFire`**: Destroy blocks specifically by fire.
* **`ChallengeObjectiveBlockUpgrade`**: Upgrade a specific block or number of blocks.
* **`ChallengeObjectiveCompleteQuestStealth`**: Complete a quest while maintaining stealth.
* **`ChallengeObjectiveCraftWithIngredient`**: Craft items using a specific ingredient.
* **`ChallengeObjectiveCraftWithTags`**: Craft items that have specific tags.
* **`ChallengeObjectiveCVar`**: Achieve a specific value for a player CVar (Console Variable).
* **`ChallengeObjectiveDecapitation`**: Achieve a certain number of decapitations.
* **`ChallengeObjectiveEnterPOI`**: Enter a specific Point of Interest (POI).
* **`ChallengeObjectiveExtinguishFire`**: Extinguish a certain number of fires.
* **`ChallengeObjectiveGatherTags`**: Gather items with specific tags.
* **`ChallengeObjectiveHarvest`**: Harvest a specific resource or quantity.
* **`ChallengeObjectiveHireNPC`**: Hire a specific NPC or number of NPCs.
* **`ChallengeObjectiveKillWithItem`**: Kill entities using a specific item.

These custom objectives allow for highly diverse and engaging challenges beyond the vanilla game's offerings.
