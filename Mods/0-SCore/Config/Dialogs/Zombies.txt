GS_start,"[Survivor nods cautiously] Seen worse days, I suppose. What are you curious about? The dead? Gear?"
GS_ask_infected,"Tell me about the 'special' infected."
GS_ask_weapons,"What weapons are most useful?"
GS_ask_tools,"What about essential tools?"
ui_greetings_generic_on_my_way,"Got to go."
GS_infected_main,"The infected? Yeah, they're not all the same slowpokes. You learn to spot the dangerous ones quick... or you don't learn anything else."
GS_resp_infected_screamer,"What about Screamers?"
GS_resp_infected_cop,"And Cops?"
GS_resp_infected_demo,"Demolishers sound bad."
GS_infected_screamer,"Watch out for the Screamers. Skinny, pale things. Don't look like much, but that shriek... it calls every walker in earshot right down on you. Shut 'em up fast if you see 'em."
GS_resp_back_infected,"Anything else about infected?"
GS_infected_cop,"The ones in old police gear? They spit some kinda nasty acid. Burns right through you. And if you damage 'em too much? Boom. Nasty explosion. Keep your distance."
GS_infected_demo,"Then there's the big ones, the Demolishers. Huge brutes wired with explosives. They charge, and if they hit something solid... well, hope you're not nearby. Takes heavy firepower to bring them down before they get close."
GS_weapons_main,"Weapons? Gotta have options. Something for range, something for when they get too close for comfort. And ammo... never enough ammo."
GS_resp_weapons_ranged,"What kind of ranged weapons?"
GS_resp_weapons_melee,"Best melee options?"
GS_weapons_ranged,"Ranged? A good rifle helps pick 'em off before they're a threat. Shotguns are great for crowd control up close, but loud. Pipe guns... better than nothing, but jam easy. Crossbows are quiet, if you can find bolts."
GS_resp_back_weapons,"Anything else about weapons?"
GS_weapons_melee,"Melee? You want something sturdy. Sledgehammers hit hard. Reinforced clubs, spears for keeping distance. Even a good shovel works. Forget flimsy knives unless you like getting bit."
GS_tools_main,"Tools are almost as important as weapons. Can't build, can't fix, can't get resources without 'em. Good tools mean better survival, simple as that."
GS_resp_tools_resource,"Tools for gathering resources?"
GS_resp_tools_building,"What about for building or repairs?"
GS_resp_tools_other,"Any other important tools?"
GS_tools_resource,"For resources? Need a good axe for wood, pickaxe for stone and ore. A salvage tool, like a wrench or ratchet, helps break down metal stuff faster. Makes scavenging worthwhile."
GS_resp_back_tools,"Anything else about tools?"
GS_tools_building,"Building and fixing? Claw hammer, wrench, maybe a wire tool for electrical traps if you're fancy. Keeping your walls strong and your gear repaired is half the battle."
GS_tools_other,"Don't forget things like a beaker for chemistry, maybe a crucible if you get a forge running. Advanced stuff needs specialized tools. Can make life a lot easier... or help you make better weapons."
GS_done,"Stay safe out there."
ZL_resp_back_to_start,"Ask about something else?"
