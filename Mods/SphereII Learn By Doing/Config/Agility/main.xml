    =========================== AGILITY LEARN BY DOING (LBD) SYSTEM OVERVIEW ===========================
    ====================================================================================================

    This file contains the complete "Learn by Doing" (LBD) progression system for the Agility attribute
    and all of its associated perks.

    HOW IT WORKS:
    This system is driven by a single, permanent, hidden "Manager Buff" (`buffLBD_AgilityManager`)
    that is always active on the player. This buff listens for player actions and grants small amounts
    of LBD experience to hidden CVars. When a CVar's XP threshold is met, it triggers a level-up
    for the corresponding perk, provided the player meets the vanilla progression requirements.

    This centralized "Manager Buff" architecture is designed to be clean, scalable, and highly
    compatible, as it does NOT directly modify any item files.

    HOW TO LEVEL UP PERKS 

    - Agility (Attribute):
      Gain small amounts of XP from performing ANY Agility-related action. Specializing in
      Agility perks will naturally level up your main Agility attribute over time.

    - Archery:
      Gain XP by damaging enemies with Bows and Crossbows.

    - Gunslinger:
      Gain XP by damaging enemies with Handguns.

    - Deep Cuts:
      Gain XP by damaging enemies with Bladed Weapons.

    - Parkour:
      Gain XP by successfully enduring and mitigating the impact of significant falls,
      reflecting improved control and resilience.

    - Hard Target:
      Gain XP by taking damage from zombies and animals while moving, rewarding mobile defense.

    - Run and Gun:
      Gain XP by damaging enemies with firearms while actively moving (running or walking),
      rewarding accuracy on the move.

    - Hidden Strike:
      Gain XP by successfully executing stealth attacks on unaware enemies, rewarding precision
      from the shadows.

    - From the Shadows:
      Gain XP by actively moving (walking or running) while crouched in low light conditions,
      rewarding sustained stealth.

    - Flurry of Agility:
      Gain bonus XP by landing rapid, successive strikes with Bladed Weapons, rewarding a
      "whirlwind of slashes" combo playstyle.
