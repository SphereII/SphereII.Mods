    ======================== GENERAL PERKS LEARN BY DOING (LBD) SYSTEM OVERVIEW ========================
    ====================================================================================================

    This file contains the complete "Learn by Doing" (LBD) progression system for general perks
    that are not directly tied to a specific primary attribute.

    HOW IT WORKS:
    This system is driven by a single, permanent, hidden "Manager Buff" (`buffLBD_GeneralManager`)
    that is always active on the player. This buff listens for player actions and grants small amounts
    of LBD experience to hidden CVars. When a CVar's XP threshold is met, it triggers a level-up
    for the corresponding perk, provided the player meets the vanilla progression requirements.

    This centralized "Manager Buff" architecture is designed to be clean, scalable, and highly
    compatible, as it does NOT directly modify any item files.

    HOW TO LEVEL UP PERKS

    - Master Chef:
      Gain XP by crafting food and drink items at a Campfire. A bonus is awarded for crafts
      with longer crafting times, rewarding complex culinary creations.

    - Living Off the Land:
      Gain XP by harvesting wild or bonus crops from the land, rewarding sustainable foraging.

    - Lock Picking:
      Gain XP by successfully picking locks, rewarding skill and precision.

    - Lucky Looter:
      Gain XP by successfully opening any loot container (excluding buried treasure chests),
      rewarding active scavenging.

    - Light Armor:
      Gain XP by taking damage from zombies and animals while actively wearing a majority of Light Armor,
      rewarding mobile defense.

    - Medium Armor:
      Gain XP by taking damage from zombies and animals while actively wearing a majority of Medium Armor,
      rewarding balanced defense.

    - Heavy Armor:
      Gain XP by taking damage from zombies and animals while actively wearing a majority of Heavy Armor,
      rewarding steadfast defense.
