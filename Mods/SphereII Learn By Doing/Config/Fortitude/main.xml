    ========================== FORTITUDE LEARN BY DOING (LBD) SYSTEM OVERVIEW ==========================
    ====================================================================================================

    This file contains the complete "Learn by Doing" (LBD) progression system for the Fortitude attribute
    and all of its associated perks.

    HOW IT WORKS:
    This system is driven by a single, permanent, hidden "Manager Buff" (`buffLBD_FortitudeManager`)
    that is always active on the player. This buff listens for player actions and grants small amounts
    of LBD experience to hidden CVars. When a CVar's XP threshold is met, it triggers a level-up
    for the corresponding perk, provided the player meets the vanilla progression requirements.

    This centralized "Manager Buff" architecture is designed to be clean, scalable, and highly
    compatible, as it does NOT directly modify any item files.

     HOW TO LEVEL UP PERKS 

    - Fortitude (Attribute):
      Gain small amounts of XP from performing ANY Fortitude-related action. Specializing in
      Fortitude perks will naturally level up your main Fortitude attribute over time.

    - Brawler:
      Gain XP by landing hits with Fists and Knuckles. XP is tiered, with more awarded for power attacks.

    - Machine Gunner:
      Gain XP by damaging enemies with Machine Guns.

    - Flurry of Fortitude:
      Gain bonus XP by landing rapid, successive strikes with Fists, Knuckles, or Machine Guns,
      rewarding a "combo" playstyle.

    - The Huntsman:
      Gain XP by efficiently harvesting resources from animals using butchering tools.

    - Siphoning Strikes:
      Gain XP by successfully killing enemies with melee weapons, reflecting the act of "siphoning life."

    - Pain Tolerance:
      Gain XP by enduring damage from zombies and animals while injured. Additional XP is awarded
      for being stunned, and a significant bonus for suffering a concussion.

    - Healing Factor:
      Gain XP by naturally regenerating health while experiencing hunger or thirst. XP is tiered,
      with more awarded for more severe deprivation, rewarding resilience through struggle.

    - Slow Metabolism:
      Gain XP by strategically consuming food and water when not full, and by successfully recovering
      from Dysentery, reflecting improved metabolic efficiency.

    - Rule #1: Cardio:
      Gain XP for sustained movement (running or walking), rewarding endurance and stamina efficiency.
