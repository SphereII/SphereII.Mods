    ========================== INTELLECT LEARN BY DOING (LBD) SYSTEM OVERVIEW ==========================
    ====================================================================================================

    This file contains the complete "Learn by Doing" (LBD) progression system for the Intellect attribute
    and all of its associated perks.

    HOW IT WORKS:
    This system is driven by a single, permanent, hidden "Manager Buff" (`buffLBD_IntellectManager`)
    that is always active on the player. This buff listens for player actions and grants small amounts
    of LBD experience to hidden CVars. When a CVar's XP threshold is met, it triggers a level-up
    for the corresponding perk, provided the player meets the vanilla progression requirements.

    This centralized "Manager Buff" architecture is designed to be clean, scalable, and highly
    compatible, as it does NOT directly modify any item files.

    HOW TO LEVEL UP PERKS 

    - Intellect (Attribute):
      Gain small amounts of XP from performing ANY Intellect-related action. Specializing in
      Intellect perks will naturally level up your main Intellect attribute over time.

    - Electrocutioner:
      Gain XP by damaging enemies with Stun Batons and Robotic Weapons.

    - Robotic Turrets:
      Gain XP when your deployed Turrets (Melee or Ranged) damage or kill enemies, reflecting
      their combat performance.

    - Flurry of Intellect:
      Gain bonus XP by landing rapid, successive strikes with Robotic Weapons or Stun Batons,
      rewarding a "combo" playstyle.

    - Better Barter:
      Gain XP by successfully buying or selling items at a trader, rewarding active engagement
      in commerce.

    - Daring Adventurer:
      Gain XP by successfully completing quests. XP is dynamically scaled, with higher-tier
      quests granting significantly more rewards.

    - Physician:
      Gain XP by using medical items (bandages, first aid kits, splints, etc.) to heal yourself
      or others, rewarding active medical aid.

    - Advanced Engineering:
      Gain XP by crafting items at advanced workstations (Workbenches, Forges, Chemistry Stations),
      rewarding complex fabrication.

    - Grease Monkey:
      Gain XP by crafting vehicles and high-value vehicle parts. A bonus is awarded for crafts
      with longer crafting times, rewarding complex assemblies.

    - Charismatic Nature:
      Gain XP by successfully buying or selling items at a trader, and by completing quests,
      rewarding positive social and exploratory interactions.
