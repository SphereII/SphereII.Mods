    ========================= STRENGTH LEARN BY DOING (LBD) SYSTEM OVERVIEW ============================
    ====================================================================================================

    This file contains the complete "Learn by Doing" (LBD) progression system for the Strength attribute
    and all of its associated perks.

    HOW IT WORKS:
    This system is driven by a single, permanent, hidden "Manager Buff" (`buffLBD_StrengthManager`)
    that is always active on the player. This buff listens for player actions and grants small amounts
    of LBD experience to hidden CVars. When a CVar's XP threshold is met, it triggers a level-up
    for the corresponding perk, provided the player meets the vanilla progression requirements.

    This centralized "Manager Buff" architecture is designed to be clean, scalable, and highly
    compatible, as it does NOT directly modify any item files.

    HOW TO LEVEL UP PERKS

    - Strength (Attribute):
      Gain small amounts of XP from performing ANY Strength-related action. Specializing in
      Strength perks will naturally level up your main Strength attribute over time.

    - Boomstick:
      Gain XP by damaging enemies with Shotguns.

    - Pummel Pete:
      Gain XP by damaging enemies with Clubs and Bats.

    - Skull Crusher:
      Gain XP by damaging enemies with Sledgehammers.

    - Grand Slam:
      Gain XP by landing a running power attack with a Club or Sledgehammer.

    - Flurry of Blows:
      Gain XP by landing rapid, successive strikes with a Club or Sledgehammer, rewarding a "combo" playstyle.

    - Miner 69'r:
      Gain a baseline XP reward for harvesting any block with a mining tool, and a bonus reward
      for harvesting high-value resources like ore and trees.

    - Mother Lode:
      Gain XP specifically for harvesting high-value resources (ore, trees) with a mining tool.

    - Junk Miner:
      Gain XP by harvesting mechanical/electronic salvage (e.g., cars) with a mining tool.

    - Pack Mule:
      Gain a small, steady amount of XP for moving while encumbered. The more encumbered you are,
      the more XP you gain, rewarding your struggle.

    - Strength Mastery:
      The capstone perk. Gain XP by demonstrating true mastery in both fields: efficiently
      destroying high-value resource nodes and finishing off stunned or knocked-down enemies.
