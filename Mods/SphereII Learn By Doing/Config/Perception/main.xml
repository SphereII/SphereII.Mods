    ======================== PERCEPTION LEARN BY DOING (LBD) SYSTEM OVERVIEW ===========================
    ====================================================================================================

    This file contains the complete "Learn by Doing" (LBD) progression system for the Perception attribute
    and all of its associated perks.

    HOW IT WORKS:
    This system is driven by a single, permanent, hidden "Manager Buff" (`buffLBD_PerceptionManager`)
    that is always active on the player. This buff listens for player actions and grants small amounts
    of LBD experience to hidden CVars. When a CVar's XP threshold is met, it triggers a level-up
    for the corresponding perk, provided the player meets the vanilla progression requirements.

    This centralized "Manager Buff" architecture is designed to be clean, scalable, and highly
    compatible, as it does NOT directly modify any item files.

    HOW TO LEVEL UP PERKS

    - Perception (Attribute):
      Gain small amounts of XP from performing ANY of the actions listed below. Specializing in
      Perception perks will naturally level up your main Perception attribute over time.

    - Dead Eye:
      Gain XP by damaging enemies with Rifles.

    - Demolitions Expert:
      Gain XP for each enemy damaged by an explosion you caused. There is no cooldown,
      rewarding effective multi-kills.

    - Javelin Master:
      Gain XP by damaging zombies and animals with Spears.

    - Salvage Operations:
      Gain XP by harvesting blocks that yield salvage (e.g., cars, couches) with a salvage tool.

    - Animal Tracker:
      Gain XP for killing and harvesting animals. A large bonus is granted for skillful kills
      (headshots or sneak attacks).

    - Flurry of Perception:
      Gain XP by landing rapid, successive strikes with a Spear, rewarding a "combo" playstyle.

    - The Penetrator:
      Gain a baseline XP reward for damaging tough, armored enemies (Ferals, Soldiers, etc.)
      and a massive bonus for hitting multiple targets with a single shot.

    - Treasure Hunter:
      Gain a small amount of XP for digging in the treasure quest area and a massive reward for
      successfully looting the final treasure chest.

    - The Infiltrator:
      Gain XP for crafting and placing traps. A "Placement Credit" system is used to prevent
      exploits, ensuring XP is only granted for placing "fresh" mines (crafted or looted).

    - Perception Mastery:
      The capstone perk. Gain XP by performing all the core activities of a Perception build:
      scrounging with salvage tools, and dealing damage with Rifles and Spears.
