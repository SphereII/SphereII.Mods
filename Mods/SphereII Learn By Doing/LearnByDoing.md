# Learn by Doing: Character Progression Reimagined!

Welcome to a new way of growing your survivor in the wasteland! Beyond just spending skill points, your character will
now get stronger and more skilled simply by *doing* what they do best. This "Learn by Doing" (LBD) system adds a new
layer of immersive progression, making every action count.

## How Does "Learn by Doing" Work?

Instead of earning skill points to unlock perk levels, certain perks and even your main attributes (Perception,
Strength, etc.) will now level up automatically as you perform actions related to them.

Think of it like this:

* **You swing a club at a zombie?** You're practicing your club.
* **You harvest some iron ore?** You're honing your mining skills.
* **You survive a brutal zombie attack?** You're getting tougher.

The more you engage in an activity, the more proficient your character becomes in the related skill.

## What Levels Up by Doing?

Every main attribute (Perception, Strength, Fortitude, Agility, Intellect) and many of their associated perks now have
an LBD progression. Hereâ€™s a general idea of how each type of skill grows:

### Main Attributes (Perception, Strength, Fortitude, Agility, Intellect)

Your core attributes will increase as you perform **any** action related to that attribute's skill tree. For example,
using a rifle, throwing a grenade, or digging for treasure will all contribute to your overall **Perception**. This
means specializing in a few perks will naturally boost your main attribute over time.

### Perk Progression

Each perk levels up by performing specific, related actions:

* **Combat Perks (e.g., Dead Eye, Brawler, Machine Gunner, Electrocutioner, Deep Cuts, Gunslinger, Javelin Master):**
* **How to Level:** Deal damage or get kills using the specific weapons or attack types associated with the perk.
* **Example:** Shooting zombies with a pistol levels up Gunslinger. Hitting enemies with **Fists or Knuckles** levels up
  Brawler.

* **Utility & Specialist Combat Perks (e.g., Demolitions Expert, Flurry of [Attribute], The Penetrator, Siphoning
  Strikes):**
* **How to Level:** These perks require more specific actions.
* **Example:** Demolitions Expert levels up for each enemy hit by your explosives. Flurry perks require landing rapid,
  successive hits with specific weapon types. The Penetrator rewards hitting armored targets or getting multi-kills.
  Siphoning Strikes grows as you successfully kill enemies with melee weapons (reflecting life siphoned).

* **Survival & Gathering Perks (e.g., Miner 69'r, The Huntsman, Living Off the Land, Salvage Operations, Junk Miner):**
* **How to Level:** Perform resource gathering actions with the right tools.
* **Example:** Mining ore levels up Miner 69'r. Harvesting animals levels up The Huntsman. Breaking down cars with a
  pickaxe levels up Junk Miner.

* **Movement & Defense Perks (e.g., Parkour, Light/Medium/Heavy Armor, Rule #1: Cardio, From the Shadows, Hidden Strike,
  Pain Tolerance, Pack Mule, Slow Metabolism):**
* **How to Level:** These perks improve as you put your body or gear to the test.
* **Example:** Taking significant falls levels up Parkour. Taking damage while wearing light armor levels up Light
  Armor. Moving while heavily burdened levels up Pack Mule. Enduring severe hunger/thirst levels up Slow Metabolism.

* **Intellect & Influence Perks (e.g., Advanced Engineering, Grease Monkey, Better Barter, Daring Adventurer, Physician,
  Charismatic Nature, Robotic Turrets, Master Chef, Lock Picking, Lucky Looter, The Infiltrator, Treasure Hunter):**
* **How to Level:** Engage in crafting, trading, questing, healing, or managing technology.
* **Example:** Crafting complex items levels up Advanced Engineering. Completing quests levels up Daring Adventurer.
  Healing yourself or others levels up Physician. Crafting or placing traps levels up The Infiltrator.

### Mastery Perks (e.g., Perception Mastery, Strength Mastery, Fortitude Mastery, Agility Mastery, Intellect Mastery)

These are your ultimate capstone perks. They **do not** level up from gaining XP in the traditional sense. Instead, they
represent your overall mastery of an attribute.

* **How to Level:** Mastery perks level up automatically as your **main attribute** (e.g., `Perception`) reaches
  specific level milestones. For example, you might unlock a new tier of Perception Mastery when your `attPerception`
  reaches Level 3, then Level 5, Level 7, Level 9, and finally Level 10.
* **Why it's designed this way:** It ensures that overall proficiency in the attribute leads to the ultimate mastery.

## Important Notes for Players:

* **No Skill Points Needed:** You don't spend skill points on these LBD perks. They level up passively in the
  background.
* **Check Your Perks Window:** You can see the progress of your LBD perks and attributes in your character's Perks
  window. Look for the progress bars!
* **No Exploits:** The system is designed to prevent spamming actions for quick XP. There are internal cooldowns and
  specific conditions that must be met for XP to be granted.
* **Natural Progression:** Just play the game as you normally would! Your character will naturally become more skilled
  in the areas you focus on.

### Skill Decay: Use It or Lose It!

To add a layer of realism and strategic depth, your skills (both main attributes and LBD perks) can now **decay** if you
don't use them for a long period of time.

* **How it Works:** Each LBD skill has a hidden "inactivity timer." Every few game days (or real-time hours, depending
  on server settings), this timer will tick up if you haven't performed any actions related to that specific skill.
* **When Decay Occurs:** If the inactivity timer for a skill reaches a certain threshold (e.g., 7 days of not using your
  mining tools), you will lose one level in that skill.
* **Resetting the Timer:** Simply performing any action related to that skill (e.g., hitting a zombie for Brawler,
  harvesting an animal for The Huntsman, or mining ore for Miner 69'r) will reset its inactivity timer back to zero.
* **Why it's Designed This Way:** It encourages players to diversify their activities and maintain proficiency across
  their learned skills. It means your character's skills truly reflect their current gameplay style, adding a dynamic
  challenge to long-term survival.

Enjoy becoming a true master of the wasteland, one action at a time, and remember to keep those skills sharp!
