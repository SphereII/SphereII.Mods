Excellent question. Blending book-smarts with hands-on experience is a perfect way to create a deep and rewarding "Learn
by Doing" system. Instead of having two separate paths, you can make them dependent on each other, creating a compelling
gameplay loop that encourages both exploration and crafting.

Here are a few ideas, starting with the most robust concept.

### Idea 1: The "Unlocked Potential" Model (Recommended)

This is the most engaging model. Think of it as **Books set the potential, and Crafting achieves it.**

Your single crafting quality counter (e.g., 1 to 100) is split into two hidden values:

1. **Practical Skill:** Your current, actual crafting ability. This is what determines the quality of the item you
   craft.
2. **Theoretical Knowledge:** The maximum potential skill you can achieve. This acts as a cap on your Practical Skill.

**How it Works:**

* **Starting Out:** A new player starts with a low Practical Skill and a low Theoretical Knowledge cap. For example,
  `Practical Skill: 1` and `Theoretical Knowledge: 10`.
* **Learning by Doing (Crafting):** Every time the player crafts an item (e.g., a stone axe), they gain "crafting XP"
  for that category (Tools). This XP raises their `Practical Skill` level. They can craft items over and over to raise
  their `Practical Skill` from 1, to 2, up to 10.
* **Hitting the Wall:** Once their `Practical Skill` reaches their `Theoretical Knowledge` cap (level 10), crafting more
  items gives them **no more skill increases**. They have mastered everything they know *in theory*. To get better, they
  need new knowledge.
* **Learning by Reading (Books):** The player finds and reads a relevant book (e.g., "Tool & Die Weekly Vol. 1").
  Reading this book does **not** increase their Practical Skill directly. Instead, it increases their
  `Theoretical Knowledge` cap from 10 to 20.
* **The Loop Continues:** Now that the player has new theoretical knowledge, they can return to the workbench. Their
  `Practical Skill` is still 10, but the cap is now 20. They can once again gain skill by crafting items, pushing their
  practical ability towards their new potential.

**Why this model is great:**

* **Creates a Perfect Loop:** It forces players to alternate between exploring the world for books and spending time at
  their base crafting. One activity is useless for progression without the other.
* **Makes Books Feel Essential:** Finding a book isn't just a small, incremental boost. It's a major breakthrough that
  unlocks the next tier of progression, which feels incredibly rewarding.
* **Prevents Mindless Grinding:** Players can't just craft 1,000 stone axes on day one to max out their skill. They are
  gated by their knowledge.

### Idea 2: The "Synergy" Model

This is a simpler, more direct approach where both activities contribute XP to the same skill pool, but crafting more
complex items is required for mastery.

**How it Works:**

1. **Book XP:** Reading a book provides a large, flat amount of XP towards the relevant skill. For example, reading "
   Enforcer Magazine" might grant 250 `Firearms Crafting` XP.
2. **Crafting XP:** Crafting an item also provides XP, but the amount depends on the **quality of the item crafted.**

* Crafting a Quality 1 Pistol might give 10 XP.
* Crafting a Quality 2 Pistol gives 15 XP.
* Crafting a Quality 3 Pistol gives 25 XP, and so on.

3. **The "Soft-Lock":** To gain any meaningful amount of XP from crafting, you must be ableto craft higher-quality
   items. The best way to get the initial boost needed to craft those higher-quality items is by reading books.

**Why this model works:**

* You can technically level up by crafting thousands of low-quality items, but it's incredibly inefficient.
* Reading books gives you the boost you need to start crafting higher-quality items, which in turn accelerates your XP
  gain from crafting. It encourages you to use your newfound knowledge immediately.

### Idea 3: The "Practice Makes Perfect" Model

In this model, books are still important, but the focus is on rewarding the player for successfully crafting items at
their highest possible skill level.

**How it Works:**

1. **Books Increase Quality:** The system works as it does nowâ€”reading books is the primary way to increase your
   crafting quality level (e.g., from 45 to 46).
2. **"Inspired Crafting" Bonus:** When you craft an item that is at, or very close to, your current maximum quality
   level, you have a chance to trigger a "moment of inspiration."
3. **The Bonus:** This inspiration gives you a small, but permanent, bonus point to your crafting quality skill, as if
   you had found and read another book. For example, if your max skill is 50 and you manage to craft a Quality 50 item,
   the game might reward you with a permanent increase to 51.

**Why this model works:**

* It keeps the core loop of finding books intact.
* It adds a "Learn by Doing" element by rewarding players for paying attention to their crafting inputs (using
  high-grade materials to try and hit that max quality).
* It provides a way to progress, albeit slowly, even if a player is having bad luck finding the specific books they
  need.
