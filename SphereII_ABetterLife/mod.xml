<!-- 
  This Mod adds features into the base game to give the water biomes more life, by allowing distribution of custom water decorations in 
  the way of additional plants and other decorations for the bottom and edge of the water biomes. It includes a custom class that can be re-used to 
  add under water entities like fish, turtles, and other resources. 

  The sand at the bottom of the water has been changed to be clay, to give it a more earthy underwater feeling. Sea weed and other underwater
  decorations have been added as well.
  
  Fish can be killed and harvested to produce either raw meat or raw fish meat, which allows for additional cooking recipes. 

  Assets that are included in this mod were found and added by xyth and sphereii. Additional XML tweaks were included from Clockwork Orange 
  
  
  In addition to fish, butterflies and birds have been added to this mod package.
  Permission is granted for re-use
