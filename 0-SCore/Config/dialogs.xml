    SCore Documentation for the Dialog System
    
    The SCore includes some extra scripts to help enhance the Dialog system to be more flexible.
  
  -->
    <!-- [ Introduction ]   -->
    <!-- 
  
  
    The Dialog system uses a series of NPC statements with player responses.  Each of the player's responses can have requirements on whether or not to display.
    
    Each NPC can have their own dialog chain, as defined in their npc.xml entry's dialog id's reference to the dialog id in the dialogs.xml. NPCs can also share the same dialog.
    
    A dialog entry starts off with a system-wide unique id, along with an startstatementid, which tells the game which statement to show first when opening up a dialog with that NPC.
    
    The statement node needs an dialog entry-wide unique id, along with a text attribute. The text attribute is used to store the localization key to the full dialog statement.
    
    Example: 
      This is the start of the dialog id called Alfred, and when first talking to Alfred, it will display the start statement.
      
      <dialog id="Alfred" startstatementid="start">
      
      
    Inside each statement node, there's one or more response_entrys with an id. This response entry id is a reference to the full response node itself, which further defines what the player can say.
    
    Example:
      This start statement will display the localized dialog_trader_statement_start to the player as an initial NPC greeting. The player will be presented two possible responses: help, or done.
      
      <statement id="start" text="dialog_trader_statement_start">
			  <response_entry id="help" />  
        <response_entry id="done" />
      </statement>

    Response nodes are used to further define what the player can say, what happens when they say it, and when they can say it. Each response has an id that is referenced by the response_id, along with a text attribute
    which acts like a localization key. Each response also includes a nextstatementid attribute; This tells the system which statement to load when this response is selected.
    
    Example:
      This response is called help. The player will see the localized entry for helpdialogkey. When the player clicks on this response, the start statement id loaded.
        
        <response id="help" text="helpdialogkey" nextstatementid="start" />
    
    A response node can contain optional actions and requirements. 
    
    Actions can trigger certain events and code-based events. Requirements are conditions that must be true in order for the response to show up to the player. If multiple requirements are listed, all requirements must 
    be true for the dialog to show up.  
    
    Note: All requirements have a requirementtype of Hide.  The alternative to hide is not implemented.
    
    Example:
      The Help response will only show up if the player is an Admin, or in God-mode. This example also has a special Action node. When this response is clicked, it will open up the Trade window.
      
      After the Action is completed, the nextstatementid will trigger. In this case, once the trader window is closed, the player will be taken back to the initial start dialog.
            
      If the player is not in God-mode, the help response will not show up at all. Using the start statement from above, only the "done" response would show up.
      
      <response id="help" text="helpdialogkey" nextstatementid="start">
 			  <requirement type="Admin" requirementtype="Hide" />
			  <action type="Trader" id="trade" />
		  </response>

      If the nextstatementid is not defined, the dialog window will close.

      <response id="done" text="dialog_trader_response_nevermind" />

    <!-- [ Requirements ]-->
    <!--
      Requirements
      ============
      
      The following requirements are vanilla requirements:
      
      Admin
        Checks if the game is in debug mode
        
        <requirement type="Admin" requirementtype="Hide" />

      Buff
        Does nothing.

      DroneState
        Used for the drone to check what its current state is. Code specific to EntityDrone, so it cannot be used with any other class.
        
        Valid States are:   Stay, Follow, Heal
        
        Note: Stay and Follow are orders defined by EntityDrone.Orders.  Heal is a fall-through. 

        True if the drone has the order to stay.
		      <requirement type="DroneState" value="Stay" requirementtype="Hide" />

      The following series of Quests are pretty specific to trader functions. It can be argued that there's little need to replicate or try to re-use these, as some are tied very closely to the EntityTrader class. 
      
      QuestAvailable
        Checks to see if the EntityTrader has any quest available for the player. Used by the default trader.
        
          <requirement type="QuestsAvailable" requirementtype="Hide" />

      QuestStatus
        Checks to see if there's any quest in the particular state. Used by the default trader.
        
        Valid Values are InProgress, NotStarted, TurnInReady, Completed, CanReceive, CannotReceive
        
    			<requirement type="QuestStatus"  requirementtype="Hide" value="InProgress" />

      QuestTierHighest
        Checks to see if the highest tier of quests has been unlocked yet.
        
          <requirement type="QuestTierHighest" requirementtype="Hide" value="2" />

      QuestTier
        Checks to see if a tier of quest can be accessed.  
        
          <requirement type="QuestTier" requirementtype="Hide" value="2" />

        
      
      Remember that all requirements in a response must be true to show up to the player, otherwise the dialog option won't display to the player.
      
      The following new requirements were add to the SCore to help improve modability. 


      Faction

          Valid Values are: neutral, hate, dislike, Like, love, and leader.
       
          This requirement is true if the player has a neutral relationship with the trader. Otherwise, it will not show.

            gt : greater than
            gte : greater than or equal to
            
            Note: If operator is not specified, it defaults to eq.
            
        If the player's standing in the faction is less than 400, it will show the response.
          <requirement type="FactionValue, SCore" requirementtype="Hide" value="400" operator="lt" />

    <!-- [ Actions ] -->
    <!--
    
    Actions are events that trigger game code. They get fired if all the requirements of a response are met, and are fired before it moves to the nextstatementid, if those are specified.
    
    The following vanilla Actions are available:
    
    Trader
      Opens the trader window. 
    	
        <action type="Trader" id="trade" />
    
      Forces the inventory of the trader to be refreshed.
      
   			<action type="Trader" id="restock" />
  
      Forces the quest lists to be refreshed.
      
   			<action type="Trader" id="reset_quests" />
      
    AddJournalEntry
      Adds the journal entry using the localization key

      Adds the myBuff to the player.
   			<action type="AddBuff" id="myBuff" />

    AddItem
      Creates and gives the player the specified item. 
      
      Note: Value is treated differently, depending on if the specified item has a Quality level or not. 
            Without a quality level, the value is the count of how many of that item to give to the player.
            
            If the item has a quality level, value will be used to specify at what quality level to make the item at.  
            If Value has a comma in it, it'll treat the value as a min and max value of quality, and randomize it.
      
      Gives the player myItem
  			<action type="AddItem" id="myItem" />

      Gives the player 2 myItem
  			<action type="AddItem" id="myItem" value="2" />

      Gives the player an item with a quality level 2
  			<action type="AddItem" id="myQualityItem" value="2" />

      Gives the player an item with a random quality level between 2 and 3
  			<action type="AddItem" id="myQualityItem" value="2,3" />

    AddQuest

        <action type="AddCVar, SCore" id="myCvar" value="1" operator="set" />

      This will add 1 to the existing cvar called myCVar.  If the cvar does not exist, it will be added with an initial value of 0.
        <action type="AddCVar, SCore" id="myCvar" value="1" operator="add" />

      This will remove 1 from the existing cvar. If the cvar does not exist, it will be added with an initial value of 0.
