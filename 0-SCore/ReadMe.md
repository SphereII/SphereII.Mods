		- Added Chunk visible feature for the NPCs.
			When the chunk is not visible, the NPC's gravity will be turned off.
			When thec hunk is visible, the NPC's gravity will be turned on.
			This is a potential fix for NPCs disappearing at bases, with the theory that they are falling out of the world.
			Thanks to closer_ex

	[ UAI ]
		- New Utility AI task. 
			- Look for a PathingCode on the NPC, and start patrolling about between all the codes.
			- NPC will scan for all PathingCubes nearby for a code that matches its Cvar PathingCode.

			- Optional buff will fire when the NPC reaches its target point.
				- Task will not end until the buff expires
				- Once buff expires, NPC will go to its next location.
				- If you want an NPC to walk to a point, and stand there for 10 seconds, have the buff's duration set to 10.


			Basic Example:

			<action name="Patrol" weight="3" entity_filter="IsSelf" >
				<task class="Patrol, SCore" run="false" buff="IsGathering"/>

				<consideration class="HasPathingCode, SCore" />
				<consideration class="EnemyNotNear, SCore" distance="15"/>

Version: 20.3.105.1149

	[ Quests ]
		- FuriousRamsay has been working on fixing the distance restriction bug on quests
		- New Objectives:   
			RandomGotoSDX, SCore
				<objective type="RandomGotoSDX, SCore" value="700-800" phase="1">
					<property name="completion_distance" value="50"/>
					<property name="nav_object" value="quest" />
				</objective>

			RandomPOIGotoSDX, SCore
				<objective type="RandomPOIGotoSDX, SCore" value="400-800">
					<property name="phase" value="1"/>
					<property name="nav_object" value="quest" />
				</objective>

		- NetPackageQuestGotoPointSDX and NetPackageQuestGotoPointSDX to allow distance checks to work on dedicated servers ( FuriousRamsay )

	[ MinEvents ]
		MinEventActionChangeFactionSDX2: Same as the MinEventActionChangeFactionSDX, except it resets the entity's attack and revenge target ( FuriousRamsay )
			<triggered_effect trigger="onSelfBuffStart" action="ChangeFactionSDX2, SCore" target="self" value="undead" /> 
		
		MinEventActionResetTargetsSDX: Resets the target's attack and revenge targets.
			 <triggered_effect trigger="onSelfDamagedOther" action="MinEventActionResetTargetsSDX, SCore"/>


	[ NPCs ]
		- Added FuriousRamsay's fixes for SetDead(), and OnMission collision ( should be able to fly with NPCs now )
	
	[ Caves ]
		- Fixed issue where random blocks would appear underground during the decoration phase.
		- Modified Cave prefab locations to help avoid isolated prefabs
		- Fixed an issue where the first level of caves did not have decorations.
		- Currently, no cave openings are available when cave types are Mountain or DeepMountain.

	[ Crop Management ]	
		- Initial Implementation of Advanced Crop Management features. This will likely be buggy.

		- There's a lot to unpack here. Buckle up.

		- When enabled, crops will need to be within a 5x5 block radious of water block. 
			This is configurable with the WaterRange on a per-plant basis. Default is 5.
			Each plant will record where it's water blocks are. 
			The CheckInterval is used to determine how often the plant will check its water source.
				- If the water is gone when checked, the plant will rescan for a new block.
				- If no new water block is found, it will wilt.
				- Whenever a plant successfully checks in with water, it will do 1 point of damage to the water.
					- When a water block's damage exceeds its max damage (100 by default), it will turn into air.
			Crop data is not persisted to disk. Rather, if data is missing, it simply rechecks and re-discovers.

		- SCore's blocks.xml contains a new entry:
			<!-- Turns on support for the PlantGrowingSDX, SCore features for more advanced crop -->
			<property class="CropManagement" >
				<!-- Turns on logging to help debug -->
				<property name="Logging" value="false"/>

				<!-- Controls if crops are to be managed -->
				<property name="CropEnable" value="false"/>
				
				<!-- How often the crops should check for water -->
				<property name="CheckInterval" value="600" />

				<!-- How many pipes to scan -->
				<property name="MaxPipeLength" value="500" />
			</property>

			As always, it is not recommended to change the SCore's blocks.xml directly when adjusting, but rather use a modlet:
				<!-- Turning on Crops-->
				<set xpath="/blocks/block[@name='ConfigFeatureBlock']/property[@class='CropManagement']/property[@name='CropEnable']/@value">true</set>

				<!-- Checks how often the Crop Manager will check in with the plants. -->
				<set xpath="/blocks/block[@name='ConfigFeatureBlock']/property[@class='CropManagement']/property[@name='CheckInterval']/@value">120</set>

			
		- Crops that you want to manage under the advanced crop management must use the new classes:
			BlockPlantGrowingSDX

			It supports the following properties:
				RequireWater: [ true/false ]
					Allows invidiaul plants to control whether they need water or not. 
					- This can be read using extends, but overridden by the individual block
				WaterRange: [ 5 ]
					Allows individual plants to control how far away their water can be.
					- This can be read using extends, but overridden by the individual block
				PlantGrowing.Wilt: [ treeDeadPineLeaf ]
					If a plant goes without water for tool long, it will wilt into this block.
					- Can be air as well.
				Wilt: [ true / false ]: default false.
					- If a plant cannot find a water source, it will wilt and destroy itself.

			Example XML to convert all growable crops to use water.

				<!-- Setting up defaults -->
				<!-- Changing all crops to using the PlantGrowingSDX class -->
				<set xpath="/blocks/block[@name='cropsGrowingMaster']/property[@name='Class']/@value">PlantGrowingSDX, SCore</set>
				<append xpath="/blocks/block[@name='cropsGrowingMaster']">
					<!-- If the crop needs water to survive. Default: false -->
					<property name="RequireWater" value="true" /> 

					<!-- how far away that block can be from a water source: Default is 5 -->
					<property name="WaterRange" value="5" />  

					<!-- The block the crop downgrades too if its dead. Default: Air-->
					<property name="PlantGrowing.Wilt" value="treeDeadPineLeaf"/>

					<!-- if set to true, the plant will die when there is no water near by. -->
					<property name="Wilt" value="true" />
				</append>

		- In order to better support crops, and make them more fun, support for water pipes have been added.
			Two new classes have been written:
				BlockWaterPipeSDX: This block designates a block as a water carrier. It is not a water source itself, but can allow water to 'move' through. 
					- One section of the pipe must touch a water source block.

					- In this example, I convert all metalPipe's to be used as water pipes
						<append xpath="/blocks/block[starts-with(@name, 'metalPipe')]">
							<property name="Class" value="WaterPipeSDX, SCore" />
						</append>

				BlockWaterSourceSDX: This block designates a block as a water distributor. It is not a water source itself.
					- if the BlockWaterSourceSDX is connected to a series of BlockWaterPipeSDX which is connected to a water source block, it will act like a water source block.

					- In this example, I'm using the metalPipeValue as a distributor
						<set xpath="/blocks/block[@name='metalPipeValve']/property[@name='Class']/@value">WaterSourceSDX, SCore</set>


			A water source block is currently defined as:
				BlockLiquidV2 : Water from a river, lake, or dumped from a bucket
				terrBedRock: if you connect a pipe to bedrock, it will act as an unlimited water source.

				Any block is the property WaterSource is set on it, and set to true
					<property name="WaterSource" value="true" />

			




Version: 20.3.101.172
	- Fixed recursive method that was causing crashes on MarkToUnload()
	- Modified TileEntityAlwaysActive patch.
		If any TileEntity has this XML property, it will be Always On.

		Suggestions on fleshing it out more would be to add in SpawnCubes to the blockplaceholders that spawn more zombies.
	- Fixed double spawns on SpawnCube on dedi
	- Turned off SmarterEntities by default in blocks.xml, to get rid of the path node warnings.
		- Max revisit later if functionality has changed due to turning it off.

	- Merged khzmusik's fix for infinite resource bug

 Version: 20.2.57.x
	- Loot task work.
	- SpawnCube breaks after trigger now.

Version: 20.2.56.x

	- Fixed issue with Attack UAI being locked when target was still visible but not accessible.

Version: 20.2.55.x
	- Fixed issue with bad ray cast, causing NPCs to shoot through doors and walls
	- Multiple fixes to the BlockSpawnCube2SDX. This cube will allow you to spawn in a one-time entity.
		Example Usage:
	        <property name="Class" value="SpawnCube2SDX, SCore" />
			<!-- Will spawn NPC furiousRamsayBristonStart_FR, give them the buffOrderStay, pathing cube 0, and auto-assigns yourself as their leader -->
            <property name="Config" value="ec=FuriousRamsayBristonStart_FR;buff=buffOrderStay;pc=0;leader=true" />
			
			<!-- Will spawn the NPC and ordered to Stay. They do not have a pathing code, no leader -->
			<property name="Config" value="ec=FuriousRamsayBristonStart_FR;task=stay" />


		Note: There is a delay of about 5 seconds on MP servers for the leader to be auto-assigned.

	- Added support for new cvar called FailOnDistance.
		- If this cvar is set on the player, all hired NPCs will use this FailOnDistance range, rather than the one hard coded in the utilityai.
		- If this cvar is set on the NPC, then that NPC will use that range, instead of the one on the player or utilityai.


Version: 20.2.45
	- Added IsAlwaysAwake to be false. This allows Sleeping NPCs to be fully awake on spawn in.
		XML Property can be toggled with the following line:
			<property name="SleeperInstantAwake" value="false" />
			<property name="SleeperInstantAwake" value="true" />

	- Reduced the Auto-scan for pathing cubes to be a lot smaller (about a block away)
	- Default PathingCode is -1, so avoid this number, as its equivalent to not having a code.
	- Gave sleeping NPCs hearing for a threhold to wake them up.
	- Disable UAI when NPCs are sleeping

	- Slightly changed the consideration for InWeaponRange, to take in effect if it should shoot a player, if it could see it, but not reach it.
[ XUI ]
	- Added a few more bindings to npc stat window

Version: 20.2.44

	- Added toggle to turn on and off Advanced signs (0-SCore/Config/blocks.xml) to turn off gif / img support 
	- Moved Sign reading data to a universal class to allow EntityAliveSDX to re-use code
	- Added EntityAliveSDX to read from a nearby Pathing Cube
		Using the PathingCube (or PathingCube2) blocks, you can place an invisible sign near a sleeper
		Once placed, you can configure it as follows
			Task=stay  [ wander, guard, follow ] 
				- This will give the nearby EntityAliveSDX a starting order. 

				Example, you could put in Task=stay for NPCs that you want to behave like a turret

				Internally, the above tasks gives SCore's based-buffs  ( buffOrderStay, buffOrderWander, etc)
				Task can also be used to specify a general buff.

		Example: https://youtu.be/IuK_sN3WHZ4

	- Fixed a null ref where NPC following a NPC leader
		With this error fixed, the old herd spawner now works. This spawner is a special EntityClass that you can add to your sleeper volume, or in entitygroups, and will spawn multiple entities.
		This can be used, for example, to set up a Solider Group, which could have an officer, along with a few grunts. The soldiers will follow the officer around as they would if hired by a player.

		For this to work, you must give them the NPCHired, or equivalent, UAI. These do not need to be hirable by the player, but must contain the follow tasks.

		When you spawn in the SoldierPackMelee entity, it'll spawn the leader and followers.

		Example: https://youtu.be/OSlfwuX9r6Y

		EntityClasses.xml example:

		<append xpath="/entity_classes">
			<entity_class name="spawnerStub">
				<property name="Mesh" value="Gore/gore_block1_bonesPrefab"/>
				<property name="ModelType" value="Custom"/>
				<property name="Prefab" value="Backpack"/>
				<property name="Class" value="EntityAliveEventSpawnerSDX, SCore"/>
				<property name="Parent" value="Animals"/>
				<property name="TimeStayAfterDeath" value="1"/>
				<property name="IsEnemyEntity" value="false"/>
				<property name="LootListOnDeath" value="banditLoot"/>
				<property name="Faction" value="animals"/>
			</entity_class>
		
			<!-- the Leader is spawned in first, then the Followers. The Followers set their Leader cvar to that of the Leader. -->
			<entity_class name="SoldierPackMelee" extends="spawnerStub">
				<property name="Prefab" value="Backpack"/>
				<property class="SpawnSettings" >
				<property name="Leader" value="survivorOfficerDPistol" />
				<!-- Params 2,3. This means that 2 to 3 of each of the followers will be spawned. -->
				<property name="Followers" value="survivorSoldier1Club,survivorSoldier2Knife,survivorSoldier4Machete" param1="2,3"/>
				</property>
			</entity_class>

			<entity_class name="SoldierPackRanged" extends="spawnerStub">
				<property name="Prefab" value="Backpack"/>
				<property class="SpawnSettings" >
				<property name="Leader" value="survivorOfficerTRifle" />
				<property name="Followers" value="survivorOfficerAK47,survivorOfficerSMG,survivorSoldier1TRifle,survivorSoldier3AK47" />
				</property>
			</entity_class>
		</append>

[ UAI Changes ]

	- Added new UAI Task called Guard. This task can replae the Stay action using IdleSDX.
		- Guard is similar to Stay and can be a replacement for Stay.
		- Two new MinEffectActions have been created for this, and is applied by the buff in the SCore's buffs.xml
			- MinEventActionGuardHere : This sets the NPC's guard position to match the player's current position, as well as the direction the player is looking.
			- MinEventActionGuardThere: This sets the NPC's guard position to match where the NPC is currently staying, with the look direction the same.
	- Added additional feature for the Wander UAI task:
		<task class="WanderSDX, SCore" interest="Loot:cntBirdnest"/>
	
		When interest is specified, there is a 30% chance triggering a TileEntity scan matching the value.
	
		For example, interest="Loot" will search for all Loot containers in the area, and pick one.
	
		If the TileEntity's entry has a :, that further allows filtering based on block name.
		
			<task class="WanderSDX, SCore" interest="Loot:cntBirdnest"/> <!-- scan for any loot container that has a block name that starts with cntBirdNest -->


		If interest is not specified, a standard wander is triggered.
