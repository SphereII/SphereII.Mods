            The name of the cvar will be "_relationship[faction name]" where "[faction name]" is the name

            relationship is initially "Hate," or is reduced to zero later. The cvar will be set again if
            the relationship becomes anything other than zero. Trying to read the value of a non-existent
            cvar will result in a value of zero anyway, so this should not affect any uses of the cvar.

            drone) use the "attack" target for non-aggressive tasks (like healing). So for NPCs, we
            should only use their revenge target, which is always the entity that damaged them.

                                Positive numbers represent amity, negative numbers represent antagonism.
                                It takes 200 points to change a faction relationship entirely
                                (e.g. from "neutral" to "like").

                                according to each one's relationship with the primary faction.
                                It should be a comma-separated list of faction names (without spaces).
                                You can not include either the target's faction, nor the "primary" faction.
                                Optional; if not specified, no faction relationships are affected, other than the
                                one between the target and primary faction.
                                In this case, it behaves exactly like the ModifyFactionSDX action.
