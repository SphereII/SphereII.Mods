<p>[ Change Log ] Version: 21. </p><pre class="fragment">Introducing the Features Folder
    Features folder will contain the harmony and scripts for an isolated feature set, rather than spread across the Harmony and Scripts folder now.
    This will help with future extraction into seperate DLLs.

<p>Version: 20.6.470.1151 </p><pre class="fragment">[ Quests / Entity Targetting ]
    - Merged in a bug fix for khzmusik.

    The revenge targets were being set on all entities in bounds, including the player hires. 
    This is now fixed, and in addition the revenge targets also will not be set on other players in the party, 
        provided those players are protected from friendly fire.

    To detect whether an entity is an ally of the player's party, I created a new IsAllyOfParty method in EntityTargetingUtilities. 
    I did not change any existing methods so there should be no risk of breaking anything.

    I also fixed an issue where the POI's full area was not covered (the Bounds constructor shrinks the size vector 
        argument in half so only a quarter of the prefab was covered).

[ MinEvent ] 
    -Added a MinEvent to attach scripts to entity transforms.
    - Note: This should not be used yet. I've added it for xyth's testing for getting zombies to create foot prints in the snow.

    Example:
        &lt;effect_group&gt;
            &lt;triggered_effect trigger="onSelfFirstSpawn" 
                action="AddScriptToTransform, SCore" 
                transform="RightFoot"    // The Game Object's Name to target.
                script="GlobalSnowEffect.GlobalSnowCollisionDetector, SphereII_Winter_Project"  // The script you want to attach:  Namespace.Script, Assembly
            /&gt;
            &lt;triggered_effect trigger="onSelfFirstSpawn" action="AddScriptToTransform, SCore" transform="LeftFoot" script="GlobalSnowEffect.GlobalSnowCollisionDetector, SphereII_Winter_Project"/&gt;
        &lt;/effect_group&gt;
</pre><p> Version: 20.6.467.917 </p><pre class="fragment">[ Quests ]
    - Merged khzmusik's new Quest Action.

        This quest objective sets the revenge targets of all entities in range.

        &lt;action type="SetRevengeTargetsSDX" id="party" value="location" phase="2" /&gt;

[ Lock Pick ]
    - Adjusted MaxGiveAmount to be 2 * the perk level

[ Music Boxes ]
    - Reformatted, and refactored

[ IsActive ]
    - Fixed some issues with the TileEntity AlwaysActive
    - Re-enabled full Winter-Project support

[ Inert ]
    - When an entity is inert, the entity is paused. No animations, no sound, no attacks, and takes no damage.
    - When an entity has the following property, it will only be active at night. Otherwise, it'll be considered inert.
          &lt;property name="EntityActiveWhen" value="night" /&gt; &lt;!-- alternative is day --&gt;
    - Added a check for TargetIsAlive if the entity is Inert or not. If it is, it's ignored.
    - Added checks for IsEnemyNearby, and CanSeeTarget to do Inert checks.
    - Added patches so inert entities will not make a sound.

[ Fire Manager ]
    - Tagged Material: Mhay to be flammable.
    - Re-factored FireManager to be clearer.
    - Added some performance tweaks:
        - Sound will not always play on each fire block. Instead, each block will have a random chance to either play a sound or not. (10% chance to play a sound)
        - Added 5% chance for a block to self-extinguish.   
        - These checks are re-evaluable on the CheckInterval time.
    - Added a check for Explosion.
        - If a block has an explosion property, and is set as flammable, the block will trigger an explosion when it downgrades.

[ Explosion Particles ]
    - The vanilla prefabExplosions array that maintains a list of possible explosion particles via the Explosion.ParticleIndex is set to 20.
    - When a game starts, the SCore will check it's ConfigurationBlock's ExternalParticles node for external particles.
        Example:
            &lt;property class="ExternalParticles"&gt;
                &lt;!-- The name is not used by the system. The index value will be displayed in the log during a game boot up. --&gt;
                &lt;!-- Review the log to find out your index. --&gt;
                &lt;!-- The Index is a GetHashCode() on the value. --&gt;
                &lt;property name="SmokeParticle" value="#@modfolder:Resources/PathSmoke.unity3d?P_PathSmoke_X" /&gt;
                &lt;property name="FireParticle" value="#@modfolder:Resources/gupFireParticles.unity3d?gupBeavis05-Heavy" /&gt; 
            &lt;/property&gt;

    - If a particle entry is detected, this particle will be registered with the main ParticleEffect.RegisterBundleParticleEffect.
        - This is the same particle effect that is used elsewhere in the system, including the Fire Manager.
    - The index of this particle will be the bundle's GetHashCode(). 
        - This value can be viewed in the log file:
            Registering External Particle: Index: -87591912 for #@modfolder(0-SCore):Resources/PathSmoke.unity3d?P_PathSmoke_X

        - This index is what you should use in your Explosion.ParticleIndex.
            &lt;property name="Explosion.ParticleIndex" value="-87591912"/&gt; 

    - This check is applied via a Harmony patch to GameManager's ExplosionClient, and will be triggered if the ParticleIndex is not within a range of 0 and 20.

    - Append to SCore's ConfigurationBlock's ExternalParticles Entry.
</pre><p>Version: 20.6.453.1912 </p><pre class="fragment">[ Effect Group Requirement ]
    - Fixed a bug where it just didn't work.

    Tested Configuration, other combinations may work:

        &lt;effect_group name="RETURN BROKEN"&gt;
            &lt;triggered_effect trigger="onSelfPrimaryActionStart" action="CreateItemSDX, SCore" item="resourceBone" &gt;
                &lt;requirement name="HoldingItemDurability, SCore" operation="Equals" value=".1"/&gt;
            &lt;/triggered_effect&gt;
        &lt;/effect_group&gt;

[ Fire Manager ]
    - No code change, however wanted to say that the SetLightOff was moved from the GameUpdate loop, and moved behind the check interval.
    - Performance increase potential.
</pre><p> Version: 20.6.453.1540 </p><pre class="fragment">[ Fire Spread ]
    - New property in Config/blocks.xml.
    - If FireSpread is false, fire will not spread to neighboring blocks.
    - Default is true, fire will spread.

[ EntityAliveSDX ]
    - Merged in FuriousRamsay's changes
        - Remove the colliders on death, so you can keep bodies around afterwards
        - Added lootable corpses.

[ Spook Theme ]
    - Fixed an issue where Spook wasn't spookie. Effects easier to tell at night.


[ Effect Group Requirements ]
    - Added a new Requirement, meant to be used in the effect_group / triggered events.
    - Note: This is completely untested.

        &lt;!-- True when the item is 100% broken --&gt;
        &lt;requirement name="HoldingItemDurability, SCore" value="1"/&gt;

        &lt;!-- True when the item is 50% broken --&gt;
        &lt;requirement name="HoldingItemDurability, SCore" value="0.5"/&gt;

    Example on an items.xml reference:
        &lt;effect_group name="Check For Broken" &gt;
            &lt;requirement name="HoldingItemDurability, SCore" value="1"/&gt;
            &lt;triggered_effect trigger="onSelfSecondaryActionStart" action="CreateItemSDX, SCore" item="whatever" /&gt;
        &lt;/effect_group&gt;
</pre><p>Version: 20.6.442.1932 </p><pre class="fragment">[ Food Spoilage ]
    - Added an additional check for PreserveBonus -99 to not spoil when taken out.

[ Lock Picking ]
    - If keyboard is not detected as the primary input device (ie, a controller is), then disable the lock mini game, and fall back to vanilla

    - Added a cvar check to fall back to regular lock picking
        - If the player has the cvar LegacyLockPick  of greater value than 0, default lock picking will be used, skipping the mini-game.

[ MinEffect ]
    Added Soleil Plein's new Console command that executes commands and passes cvar values to it.
        &lt;triggered_effect trigger = "onSelfBuffStart" action = "ExecuteConsoleCommandCVars, SCore" command = "testCommand {0} {1}" cvars = "cvar1,cvar2" /&gt;

[ Encumbrance ]
    - Needed a way to re-calculate the encumbrance when the cvar for max encumbrance triggers.
    - Not many good ways came to me for this, so I wrote a MinEffect. This will recalculate the encumbrance values.

        &lt;triggered_effect trigger = "onSelfBuffStart" action = "RecalculateEncumbrance, SCore"  /&gt;

[ Legacy Distance Terrain ]
    - Disable Legacy Distant Terrain in GameModeEditWorld mode due to reported lag.
</pre><p> Version: 20.6.247.845 [ Vehicle No Pick Up ]</p><ul>
<li>Fixed spelling error in <a class="el" href="_no_vehicle_take_8cs_source.html">NoVehicleTake.cs</a><ul>
<li>Left old name as an empty, mispelled file to be removed for A21... if I remember.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>[ Farming ]</p><ul>
<li>Added property check for Direct Water Source. &lt;property name="WaterType" value="Unlimited" &gt;</li>
<li>Any block with that set will be an unlimited water source, and will not take damage from crops.</li>
<li>Add to bedrock, or any other block you want.</li>
</ul>
<p>[ Quests ]</p><ul>
<li>ObjectiveBuffSDX now displays the localized name_key for the buff.</li>
</ul>
<p>Version: 20.6.422.831 </p><pre class="fragment">[ Vehicle No Pick Up ]
    - Fixed a bug where removing the "take" option just shifted the index, not remove the functionality.

    - Added a few filtering options, allowing modders to fine tune which vehicles can be picked up or not. 
    - The follow conditions allow for vehicle pick up, listed by the order in which they are evaluated, if the feature is enabeld in the Config Block's VehicleNoTake
        - If the vehicle has the tag: takeable
        - If the Player has the cvar: {EntityVehicleName}_pickup, and this value is greater than 0.  
            Example:     vehicleBicycle_pickup = 1
        - If the Player has the cvar: PickUpAllVehicles, and this value is greater than 0.
    - In all other cases, the vehicle's "take" command will be disabled.
</pre><p>Version: 20.6.420.840 </p><pre class="fragment">[ Encumbrance ]
    - Added a check that for block weight.
        - Previous was only checking if the Item entry had a weight.
        - Now checking ItemWeight, and if not found, will check the Block weight.
        - If both item and block has different weight, the Item weight will take priority

[ Repair From Container ]
    - Fixed the issue where the tool belt items were not being consumed.
    - Activated original Repair Block code. Code was not added to project and not built.
        - Disabled my own crummy implementation which was causing more bugs.
</pre><p>Version: 20.6.416.1123 </p><pre class="fragment">[ MinEvent ]
    Added MinEventActionSetDateToCVar
        This will set the Current Day to the CVAR $CurrentDay.

        Example: 
            &lt;triggered_effect trigger="onSelfBuffStart" action="SetDateToCVar, SCore" target="self"/&gt; 

            CVar $CurrentDay will have the current game day.


[ Farming ]
    - Added debug information to water pipes, farm plots, and crops.
        - If the player holds down the "Activate" key, it will display the information about water.

        - Ie: holding down &lt;E&gt; by default will show information about some blocks.

    - Adjusted the way that the Farming Task extracts Harvest / Items

        Seeds:
            - The first planted*1 item it finds will be the seed which is replanted.

            Example:
                &lt;drop event="Destroy" name="plantedBlueberry1" count="1" prob="0.5"/&gt;

            - All planted*1 items will be removed from the harvest / destroy lists.
            - The Farming Task will generate a new item to be used for planting.

        Harvest:
            - By default, all harvesting will continue as expected. 
            - If the NPC has a cvar for the Harvest item, it will set the min and max count to that value.

            Example:
                If MyFarmer has a cvar called "foodCropBlueberries", with a value of 5, MyFarmer will get 5 blueberries from each harvest,
                    regardless of prob or min / max count defined in the Harvest line.

    - Adjusted Farming Task Scanning to include tending to wilted plants.

    - Updated BlockWaterSourceSDX to be able to supply unlimited water, without requiring a water block itself, or doing damage.

        &lt;property name="WaterType" value="Unlimited" /&gt;

        Default is limited, and is equivalent to 
            &lt;property name="WaterType" value="Limited" /&gt;

    - The above property can also be applied to a BlockLiquidv2, and will have the same effect.
        Default is limited.

[ Fire Manager ]
    - Integrated FuriousRamsay's fix for the MinEffectAddFireDamage.
        - In some cases, a melee weapon will set fire to contents on the other side of a wall or door, if the ray cast went through the block.

    - If a container is open, do not include the contents in the broadcast scan.

[ Farming ]
    - Fixed an issue where a Plant could not consume water from the water, through the sprinkler.
    - Added a fix to help improve Farmer to reach corner farm plots
    - If a PlantGrowingSDX block has a PlantGrowing.Wilt, it will flag the plant to wilt if there's no water

    - Added new Config Block Entry called WaterParticle on CropManagement node.

        - When a plant consumes water, this particle will be applied.
        - When a plant is first planted, this particle will be applied.
        - Default particle in Bloom's Family Farming is from Guppycur. 
            It will run for 5 seconds, then stop looping.
            The particle is not removed until the plant is removed.

        Default: 
            &lt;property name="WaterParticle" value="NoParticle" /&gt;

        Bloom's Family Farming XPath:

        - Each Plant can over-ride the particle at the block level, using the same property. 
            &lt;!-- No particle for this particular plant --&gt;
            &lt;property name="WaterParticle" value="NoParticle" /&gt;

    - Fixed an issue where GetItemCount() patch was searching for ingredients twice, resulting in mis-reporting (2x amount actually available )

[ Encumbrance ]
    - Added basic encumbrance.
    - Encumbrance check fires when something is added / removed from back pack, toolbelt, and equipment.
    - Once encumbrance is calculated, it's total value is added to a cvar, specified in the Config block. By default, this is encumbranceCVar.
    - The value of the cvar is based on percent.  When set to 1f, the player is considered at MaxEncumbrance. 
        - A value of 1.5 means the player is considered to b e 50% over encumbered.
    - Maximum Encumbrance is read from the Config Block. However, if the CVar "MaxEncumbrance" is set, it will use that value instead.
        - If Max Encumrabrance drops below 0, it will be reset to the Config Block Entry.
        - The CVar will not be reset, only the value being used to perform the calculation.

    - New configuration options added to SCore's Config block
            &lt;!-- Enables item weight encumbrance on the Player bag --&gt;
            &lt;property name="Encumbrance" value="false" /&gt;

            &lt;!-- how much encumbrance before "max" threshold is set, and penalties are incurred. --&gt;
            &lt;property name="MaxEncumbrance" value="10000" /&gt;

            &lt;!-- This cvar value will be placed on the player and will be a percentage of encumbrance. --&gt;
            &lt;!-- 1f = at max encumbrance. 1.5, 50% over encumbrance --&gt;
            &lt;property name="EncumbranceCVar" value="encumbranceCVar" /&gt;

            &lt;!-- Include Tool belt? --&gt;

            &lt;!-- Include equipment ? --&gt;
            &lt;property name="Encumbrance_Equipment" value="false" /&gt;

            &lt;!-- Each item that does not have a ItemWeight property will be weighed at this value. --&gt;
            &lt;property name="MinimumWeight" value="0.1" /&gt;


        Recommend XPath:
            &lt;set xpath="/blocks/block[@name='ConfigFeatureBlock']/property[@class='AdvancedPlayerFeatures']/property[@name='Encumbrance']/@value"&gt;true&lt;/set&gt;
            &lt;set xpath="/blocks/block[@name='ConfigFeatureBlock']/property[@class='AdvancedPlayerFeatures']/property[@name='Encumbrance_ToolBelt']/@value"&gt;true&lt;/set&gt;

            &lt;set xpath="/blocks/block[@name='ConfigFeatureBlock']/property[@class='AdvancedPlayerFeatures']/property[@name='MinimumWeight']/@value"&gt;1&lt;/set&gt;

    - Each item can have a property called ItemWeight which will over-ride the MinimumWeight from the SCore's block's entry.
            &lt;property name="ItemWeight" value="10" /&gt;

    - ItemWeight can be 0, and can also be negative numbers.



[ Farming ]
    - Fixed a bug where a water sprinkler was acting as an independent water source. 
        -&gt; Water sprinkler is now checking to see if its connected to a valid water source
    - Fixed an issue where crops could be planted after a sprinkler was removed, and the area was no longer watered.
    - Added debug information on pipes to show water source, and how much water is left.
    - Added a Custom description for BlockPlantGrowing to show water information. This is for testing purposes.
            &lt;property name="DisplayInfo" value="Custom"/&gt;
    - Fixed an issue where Farmer would get bored and do nothing.

</ul>
<p>Version: 20.6.403.1003 </p><pre class="fragment">[ Farming ]
    - Fixed an issue where the sprinkler blocks were not registering themselves to the Valve System.
        - Plants will check all valves ( sprinklers ) for their water range, then calculate if its within range of the valve.
        - If there are no valves within range, plant will check for surrounding blocks for water.
</pre><p>Version: 20.6.403.2043 </p><pre class="fragment">[ Broadcast Feature ]
    - Added code for Repair / Upgrade from storage
    - Added check to see if enemy was nearby for Repair / Upgrade from storage

[ UAI Farming Task ]
    - Moved seed decrements from UAI Task to the Manage method, to more accurately subtrack seed usage.
    - Added water check to see if NPC can actually plant at the location.
    - Added a Water Valve Check
        - When a water block will scan for a water source, it'll check all the valves registered, and check if the plant is within range of the water block's water range
        - In order for this water valve to be registered, it must be on. Just having a water valve that is not on, will not be sufficient for plant needs.
                - This is different behaviour than using a regular non-valve water source.
        - If the original valve is off when a plant checks, it will look for other valves to see if there's any water available on them.
        - If none are found, it'll resort to legacy behaviour, and scan for water sources.

        - BlockWaterSourceSDX has a new property. Default is 5f.
            &lt;property name="WaterRange" value="5" /&gt;


[ Trample Code ]
    - Entities that have "notrample" cvar value greater than 0, will not cause crops to be damaged, if the crops damaged feature is enabled.
    - Entities that have a "notrample" tag will not cause crops to be damaged.

[ Quest ]
    - Added Localization support.
        ObjectiveBuffSDX_keyword  ( fall back is ObjectiveBuff_keyword, which is simply Get in English )
        &lt;buff&gt; If the buff name has a localization setting, it'll use that, in conjunaction with the keyword  Get &lt;my buff&gt;
</pre><p> Version: 20.6.381.1359 </p><pre class="fragment">[ Merge from khzmusik ]
        - Fixed a null ref when an NPC would shoot a drone.

        - Enhanced support for NPC Guard

        The Guard command, when issued from a pathing cube, sets the NPC order to Guard. Since it is not issued by the NPCs leader or owner, the guard position is set to (exactly) where the NPC is standing.

        This is different from the "GuardHere" response (aka "Stay where I am standing") in the hired NPC dialog menu. That dialog response sets the current order to Stay, and since it is issued by a player, 
            the guard position is set to the center of the block where the player is standing.

        This is all done by buffs. The buff from the pathing cube was already named "buffOrderGuard" in the C# code, but there was never a buff by that name in buffs.xml. So, I created a new buff for use by that code.

        The buff used by the dialogs was "buffOrderGuardHere", which matched an existing buff in buffs.xml. That buff is unchanged.

        Because the order is Guard, any NPC Core utility AI tasks that will not fire when the order is Stay, will still fire. This means NPCs will still run after enemies, reload, etc.

        In order to have them stay where they are when initially spawned in, and return to their guard positions after they're done attacking enemies, a new AI task will need to be 
            added in utilityai.xml. But this is not done in SCore.

        No existing behavior should be affected by these changes; only POIs that have pathing cubes with "task=guard" will need these changes, and to my knowledge nobody is doing that.

[ Fire Manager ]
    - Disabled the extinguished check to see if a block has been flagged as extinguished or not.

    - New functionality is that each time a block is extinguished, it'll set the expired time, regardless if it's already in the list, counting down.
        - If BlockA was extinguished, it can smoke for 20 seconds.
        - After 20 seconds, BlockA can catch fire again.
        - If BlockA is re-extinguished before the 20 seconds are past, expired time will be set back to 20.

    - Old functionality is that each time a block is extinguished, it'll expire after the expired time, allowing it to re-ignite.
        - If BlockA was extinguished, it can smoke for 20 seconds.
        - After 20 seconds, BlockA can catch fire again.

    - With these changes, both EntityAliveSDX and EntityEnemySDX will implement that interface. 
        - This should allow EntityEnemySDX to behave similarly to EntityAliveSDX

        - This creates a new interface named IEntityOrderReceiverSDX, which should be used on any entity that can accept orders.

        - Also, order-related blocks, MinEvents, and AI tasks are updated to use the interface type, rather than EntityAliveSDX directly.

        fixed some issues with items not being removed correctly.

[ Entity Swiming ]
    - Pushed a fix to avoid spawning fish randomly in the world.

[ Fire ]
    Note: Fire System is being refactored to fix a variety of issues.

    - Fixed particles not showing on dedi / P2P clients.

    - Changed Fire Instance start to ModEvent for GameStartDone.

    - Added Cleanup call to clear possibly stale data on client restart.

    - Added Reset() to clear all existing game blocks that are on fire or smoldering.
    - Added new console command called:  fireclear
        -&gt; Removes all recorded blocks that were on fire or extinguished, and removes their particles.

    - Fixed an issue with the NetPackageRemoveParticleEffect() with a useless write call.

    - Explosions that cause BlockDamage -1, will extingish fires. BlockDamage other than -1 will set fires.
        &lt;property name="Explosion.BlockDamage" value="-1"/&gt;

    - Added new property to Config/blocks.xml to control the amount of smoke time at the end of a fire, in seconds.
        &lt;property name="SmokeTime" value="60" /&gt;

    - Removed smoke particles from fires that burn themselves out. Reserving them now when you intentionally extinguish them.

    - Modified MinEvent FireDamage / FireDamageCascade to support ranged targets.
</pre><p> Version: 20.5.211.1016 </p><pre class="fragment">[ Fire ]

    - Added new Config/blocks.xml entry to allow filtering Material ID.             
        &lt;property name="MaterialID" value="Mplants, Mcorn" /&gt;   &lt;!-- Checks the material's id to see if it should ignite  --&gt;

    - Order of Material Checks, in terms of priority:
        ID
        DamageCategory
        DamageSurface

    - New block properties have been exposed, over-riding global defaults for FireParticle / SmokeParticle
        &lt;property name="FireParticle" value="#@modfolder:Resources/gupFireParticles.unity3d?gupBeavis05-Heavy" /&gt;
        &lt;property name="SmokeParticle" value="#@modfolder:Resources/PathSmoke.unity3d?P_PathSmoke_X" /&gt;

        Using NoParticle will skip the particle effect:
            &lt;property name="FireParticle" value="NoParticle" /&gt;
            &lt;property name="SmokeParticle" value="NoParticle" /&gt;

        To mass add custom particles above to blocks, consider using an xpath similar to this:

        &lt;!-- Search for all blocks that have a Material property called Mcloth, and add in the properties to that block --&gt;
        &lt;append xpath="/blocks/block[ property[@name='Material' and @value='Mcloth'] ]"&gt;
            &lt;property name="FireParticle" value=#@modfolder:Resources/gupFireParticles.unity3d?gupBeavis05-Heavy"" /&gt;   
            &lt;property name="SmokeParticle" value="#@modfolder:Resources/PathSmoke.unity3d?P_PathSmoke_X" /&gt;
        &lt;/append&gt;

    - Add new NetPackage in attempt for particles on dedi. Needs testing.

    - Added new MinEvent called AddFireDamageCascade. Defaults to block type.
        This minevent works similar to the Extinguish Minevent, in which multiple blocks of the same type around the target is affected. Rather than extinguish, it ignites those blocks instantly.

        Supported formats:

            &lt;!-- The same type of block --&gt;
            &lt;triggered_effect trigger="onSelfDamagedBlock" action="AddFireDamageCascade, SCore" range="4" filter="Type" /&gt;

            &lt;!-- Shares the same material --&gt;
            &lt;triggered_effect trigger="onSelfDamagedBlock" action="AddFireDamageCascade, SCore" range="4" filter="Material" /&gt;

            &lt;!-- Shares the same material damage classification --&gt;
            &lt;triggered_effect trigger="onSelfDamagedBlock" action="AddFireDamageCascade, SCore" range="4" filter="MaterialDamage" /&gt;

            &lt;triggered_effect trigger="onSelfDamagedBlock" action="AddFireDamageCascade, SCore" range="4" filter="MaterialSurface" /&gt;

    - Fire will not be added to trader-protected zones. We have to protect Jen.

    - Added new Config/blocks.xml properties to configure materials and surface categories to xml. Case sensitive.
        Example, and default:
            &lt;property name="MaterialDamage" value="wood, cloth" /&gt; &lt;!-- Checks the material's damage category to see if it should ignite  --&gt;
            &lt;property name="MaterialSurface" value="wood, cloth" /&gt; &lt;!-- Checks the material's surface category to see if it should ignite --&gt;

        &lt;property name="HeatMapStrength" value="1"/&gt;            &lt;!-- Determines how much each block contributes to heat --&gt;

    - Added new block's property to control how much fire damage the block is to take. Integer.

</pre><p>Version: 20.5.209.1414 </p><pre class="fragment">[ Fire Manager ]
    - Added initial implementation for lighting blocks on fire.

        - When a block is added to the FireManager, it is added to a loop that checks:
            -&gt; Is it still flammable?
            -&gt; Has it been extinguished?
            -&gt; Does damage on the block
            -&gt; If damage exceeds the block, it gets downgraded, or replaced with air. (uses block placeholder)
            -&gt; Once all blocks are checked and calculated, it updates the chunks.

    What makes a block flammable or not?

        If it's a child, it won't catch fire. If its air, water, or is near water, it will not catch fire.      

        If the block has a tag of 'inflammable', it will not be burnable.

        If the block has a tag of 'flammable', it will be marked as burnable. 
            &lt;append xpath="/blocks/block[@name='terrGravel']/property[@name='Tags']/@value"&gt;,flammable&lt;/append&gt;

        If there is not tag, and passes the other checks, it'll check the block material from materials.xml.
            if its DamageCategory is wood, or if its SurfaceCategory is plant, it will be flammable.

    - New config entry in Config/blocks.xml
    - New Harmony patch on OnEntityWalking, which checks if the block is burning and delivers a buff to an entityalive that walks through it.
    - New Harmony patch to Explosion to include blocks affected by them to catch fire.

    - New test items:
        sphereTorch - When a block is struck, it is lit on fire.
        sphereExtinguish - When a block is struck, blocks in a range of 2 of the strike position is considered extinguished.

[ Triggered Effect ]
    - Added two new triggered effects to provide support for Fire Manager

        &lt;!-- When an item has this triggered effect hits a block that is flammable, the block will catch fire --&gt;
        &lt;triggered_effect trigger="onSelfDamagedBlock" action="AddFireDamage, SCore" /&gt;

        &lt;!-- When an item has this triggered effect hits a block that is on fire, the fire still be extinguished. --&gt;

        - If desired to have bedrock as an unlimited water source, add the following property to the bedrock block:
            &lt;property name="WaterSource" value="true" /&gt;

    - Added new property to global crop data that determines how much damage to a water block happens when a crop consumes.
        - This property is defined in the CropManagement block of the SCore's configuration block.
        - Individual plants can over-ride this property if they have it defined on their block.
            - This is done on a block by block basis. If your plant has 3 growth cycles, you will have to define it for each block, with various possible amounts.
        - Default is 1.

        &lt;property name="WaterDamage" value="1" /&gt;

    - If a water source has a the WaterSource property, it is considered an unlimited source of water, so be mindful of this.

    - Highly Experimental Feature
    - New property in blocks.xml to turn this highly experimental feature on.
        &lt;property class="AdvancedRecipes" &gt;
            &lt;property name="ReadFromContainers" value="true"/&gt;
            &lt;property name="Distance" value="30" /&gt;  &lt;!-- This is not 30 blocks, but rather a distance between you and the container. This is roughly about 6 or 7 blocks.--&gt;
        &lt;/property&gt;

    - When set to true, this highly experimental feature will read from containers around the player, pulling items out, to be used in crafting recipes.
        - If crafting is cancelled, this highly experimental feature will dump the ingredients into the player backpack, rather than their original location.

    - With regards to testing this highly experimental feature, high concentrations of containers may induce lag. We may need to put in limits on how many containers it will check.

    Note: This is highly experimental feature. 

[ Food Spoilage ]

[ Food Spoilage ]
    - No code changes, documentation only:
        - Added an example items.xml entry to show how to specify food spoilage on the food items. Turning on the food spoilage in the blocks.xml does not fully activate food spoilage.
        - The blocks.xml needs to enable the food spoilage, and the foot items must contain new properties to allow spoiling.
        - khzmusik has an excellent modlet for this: https://gitlab.com/karlgiesing/7d2d-a20-modlets/-/tree/main/khzmusik_Food_Spoilage

[ Portals ]

        - If a location= only contains a single value, it's determined to be legacy
        - It will check all the portals for destination=, and then check its source=

    - Added FuriousRamsay's fixes for SetDead(), and OnMission collision ( should be able to fly with NPCs now )

[ Caves ]
    - Fixed issue where random blocks would appear underground during the decoration phase.
    - Modified Cave prefab locations to help avoid isolated prefabs
    - Fixed an issue where the first level of caves did not have decorations.
    - Currently, no cave openings are available when cave types are Mountain or DeepMountain.

[ Crop Management ] 
    - Initial Implementation of Advanced Crop Management features. This will likely be buggy.

    - There's a lot to unpack here. Buckle up.

    - When enabled, crops will need to be within a 5x5 block radious of water block. 
        This is configurable with the WaterRange on a per-plant basis. Default is 5.
        Each plant will record where it's water blocks are. 
        The CheckInterval is used to determine how often the plant will check its water source.
            - If the water is gone when checked, the plant will rescan for a new block.
            - If no new water block is found, it will wilt.
            - Whenever a plant successfully checks in with water, it will do 1 point of damage to the water.
                - When a water block's damage exceeds its max damage (100 by default), it will turn into air.
        Crop data is not persisted to disk. Rather, if data is missing, it simply rechecks and re-discovers.

    - SCore's blocks.xml contains a new entry:
        &lt;!-- Turns on support for the PlantGrowingSDX, SCore features for more advanced crop --&gt;
        &lt;property class="CropManagement" &gt;
            &lt;!-- Turns on logging to help debug --&gt;
            &lt;property name="Logging" value="false"/&gt;

            &lt;!-- Controls if crops are to be managed --&gt;
            &lt;property name="CropEnable" value="false"/&gt;

            &lt;!-- How often the crops should check for water --&gt;
            &lt;property name="CheckInterval" value="600" /&gt;

            &lt;!-- How many pipes to scan --&gt;
            &lt;property name="MaxPipeLength" value="500" /&gt;
        &lt;/property&gt;

        As always, it is not recommended to change the SCore's blocks.xml directly when adjusting, but rather use a modlet:
            &lt;!-- Turning on Crops--&gt;
            &lt;set xpath="/blocks/block[@name='ConfigFeatureBlock']/property[@class='CropManagement']/property[@name='CropEnable']/@value"&gt;true&lt;/set&gt;

            &lt;!-- Checks how often the Crop Manager will check in with the plants. --&gt;
            &lt;set xpath="/blocks/block[@name='ConfigFeatureBlock']/property[@class='CropManagement']/property[@name='CheckInterval']/@value"&gt;120&lt;/set&gt;


    - Crops that you want to manage under the advanced crop management must use the new classes:
        BlockPlantGrowingSDX

        It supports the following properties:
            RequireWater: [ true/false ]
                Allows invidiaul plants to control whether they need water or not. 
                - This can be read using extends, but overridden by the individual block
            WaterRange: [ 5 ]
                Allows individual plants to control how far away their water can be.
                - This can be read using extends, but overridden by the individual block
            PlantGrowing.Wilt: [ treeDeadPineLeaf ]
                If a plant goes without water for tool long, it will wilt into this block.
                - Can be air as well.
            Wilt: [ true / false ]: default false.
                - If a plant cannot find a water source, it will wilt and destroy itself.

        Example XML to convert all growable crops to use water.

            &lt;!-- Setting up defaults --&gt;
            &lt;!-- Changing all crops to using the PlantGrowingSDX class --&gt;
            &lt;set xpath="/blocks/block[@name='cropsGrowingMaster']/property[@name='Class']/@value"&gt;PlantGrowingSDX, SCore&lt;/set&gt;
            &lt;append xpath="/blocks/block[@name='cropsGrowingMaster']"&gt;
                &lt;!-- If the crop needs water to survive. Default: false --&gt;
                &lt;property name="RequireWater" value="true" /&gt; 

                &lt;!-- how far away that block can be from a water source: Default is 5 --&gt;
                &lt;property name="WaterRange" value="5" /&gt;  

                &lt;!-- The block the crop downgrades too if its dead. Default: Air--&gt;
                &lt;property name="PlantGrowing.Wilt" value="treeDeadPineLeaf"/&gt;

                &lt;!-- if set to true, the plant will die when there is no water near by. --&gt;
                &lt;property name="Wilt" value="true" /&gt;
            &lt;/append&gt;

    - In order to better support crops, and make them more fun, support for water pipes have been added.
        Two new classes have been written:
            BlockWaterPipeSDX: This block designates a block as a water carrier. It is not a water source itself, but can allow water to 'move' through. 
                - One section of the pipe must touch a water source block.

                - In this example, I convert all metalPipe's to be used as water pipes
                    &lt;append xpath="/blocks/block[starts-with(@name, 'metalPipe')]"&gt;
                        &lt;property name="Class" value="WaterPipeSDX, SCore" /&gt;
                    &lt;/append&gt;

            BlockWaterSourceSDX: This block designates a block as a water distributor. It is not a water source itself.
                - if the BlockWaterSourceSDX is connected to a series of BlockWaterPipeSDX which is connected to a water source block, it will act like a water source block.

                - In this example, I'm using the metalPipeValue as a distributor
                    &lt;set xpath="/blocks/block[@name='metalPipeValve']/property[@name='Class']/@value"&gt;WaterSourceSDX, SCore&lt;/set&gt;


        A water source block is currently defined as:
            BlockLiquidV2 : Water from a river, lake, or dumped from a bucket
            terrBedRock: if you connect a pipe to bedrock, it will act as an unlimited water source.

            Any block is the property WaterSource is set on it, and set to true
                &lt;property name="WaterSource" value="true" /&gt;

</pre><p>Version: 20.2.45</p><ul>
<li>Added IsAlwaysAwake to be false. This allows Sleeping NPCs to be fully awake on spawn in. XML Property can be toggled with the following line: &lt;property name="SleeperInstantAwake" value="false" &gt; &lt;property name="SleeperInstantAwake" value="true" &gt;</li>
<li>Reduced the Auto-scan for pathing cubes to be a lot smaller (about a block away)</li>
<li>Default PathingCode is -1, so avoid this number, as its equivalent to not having a code.</li>
<li>Gave sleeping NPCs hearing for a threhold to wake them up.</li>
<li>Disable <a class="el" href="namespace_u_a_i.html">UAI</a> when NPCs are sleeping</li>
<li>Slightly changed the consideration for InWeaponRange, to take in effect if it should shoot a player, if it could see it, but not reach it. [ XUI ]</li>
<li>Added a few more bindings to npc stat window</li>
</ul>
<p>Version: 20.2.44 </p><pre class="fragment">- Added toggle to turn on and off Advanced signs (0-SCore/Config/blocks.xml) to turn off gif / img support 
- Moved Sign reading data to a universal class to allow EntityAliveSDX to re-use code
- Added EntityAliveSDX to read from a nearby Pathing Cube
    Using the PathingCube (or PathingCube2) blocks, you can place an invisible sign near a sleeper
    Once placed, you can configure it as follows
        Task=stay  [ wander, guard, follow ] 
            - This will give the nearby EntityAliveSDX a starting order. 

            Example, you could put in Task=stay for NPCs that you want to behave like a turret

            Internally, the above tasks gives SCore's based-buffs  ( buffOrderStay, buffOrderWander, etc)
            Task can also be used to specify a general buff.

    Example: https://youtu.be/IuK_sN3WHZ4

- Fixed a null ref where NPC following a NPC leader
    With this error fixed, the old herd spawner now works. This spawner is a special EntityClass that you can add to your sleeper volume, or in entitygroups, and will spawn multiple entities.
    This can be used, for example, to set up a Solider Group, which could have an officer, along with a few grunts. The soldiers will follow the officer around as they would if hired by a player.

    For this to work, you must give them the NPCHired, or equivalent, UAI. These do not need to be hirable by the player, but must contain the follow tasks.

    When you spawn in the SoldierPackMelee entity, it'll spawn the leader and followers.

    Example: https://youtu.be/OSlfwuX9r6Y

    EntityClasses.xml example:

    &lt;append xpath="/entity_classes"&gt;
        &lt;entity_class name="spawnerStub"&gt;
            &lt;property name="Mesh" value="Gore/gore_block1_bonesPrefab"/&gt;
            &lt;property name="ModelType" value="Custom"/&gt;
            &lt;property name="Prefab" value="Backpack"/&gt;
            &lt;property name="Class" value="EntityAliveEventSpawnerSDX, SCore"/&gt;
            &lt;property name="Parent" value="Animals"/&gt;
            &lt;property name="TimeStayAfterDeath" value="1"/&gt;

            &lt;property name="Faction" value="animals"/&gt;
        &lt;/entity_class&gt;

        &lt;!-- the Leader is spawned in first, then the Followers. The Followers set their Leader cvar to that of the Leader. --&gt;
        &lt;entity_class name="SoldierPackMelee" extends="spawnerStub"&gt;
            &lt;property name="Prefab" value="Backpack"/&gt;

            &lt;property name="Leader" value="survivorOfficerDPistol" /&gt;
            &lt;!-- Params 2,3. This means that 2 to 3 of each of the followers will be spawned. --&gt;
            &lt;property name="Followers" value="survivorSoldier1Club,survivorSoldier2Knife,survivorSoldier4Machete" param1="2,3"/&gt;
            &lt;/property&gt;
        &lt;/entity_class&gt;

        &lt;entity_class name="SoldierPackRanged" extends="spawnerStub"&gt;

</pre><p> Version: 20.2.43.147 </p><pre class="fragment">- Version bump to catch up to the Alpha 20.2
</pre><p> [ NPC Fixes ] </p><pre class="fragment">- Due to the refactoring for the damage to block code, some issues are listed as potentially fixed only.

- NPCMOD-FT-0038        NPCs be given the ability to damage blocks

    Tested:
            &lt;action name="MeleeAttackBlock" weight="3"&gt;
                &lt;task class="AttackTargetEntitySDX, SCore" action_index="0"/&gt;
                &lt;consideration class="PathBlockedSDX, SCore"  /&gt;
                &lt;consideration class="TargetType" type="Block"/&gt;
            &lt;/action&gt;
    - Recommended that NotPathBlockedSDX, SCore for approach-style tasks

- NPCMOD-SP-0071        Hired NPC names show up twice above their heads ( Potentially )
- NPCMOD-SP-0062        Melee NPCs run max distance away from their target then begin their approach ( Potentially )
- NPCMOD-SP-0075        NPCs will get stuck on certain blocks (like trees) ( Potentially )
- NPCMOD-SP-0048        NPCs can talk to the player while fighting, until they are hit by an enemy
    - Added a call to the UAI System IsEnemyNearBy() call (10 distance).
- NPCMOD-DEDI-0006    NPCs can be hired by another player after you've hired them and log out
    - Changed the GetLeaderOrOwner() call to just check for existence of cvars as a gap solution, 
        rather than expecting the entity to be online in order for it to be valid.

- Added a new fun task ( Work in Progress. Don't use in production )
            &lt;!-- Allows the entity to place a timed charge on a door --&gt;
            &lt;action name="DoorBuster" weight="4"&gt;
                &lt;task class="BreakBlock, SCore" action_index="0"/&gt;
                &lt;consideration class="PathBlockedSDX, SCore"  /&gt;
                &lt;consideration class="TargetType" type="BlockDoorSecure"/&gt;
            &lt;/action&gt;

- Many, many UAI tweaks, cleaning up old code, ironing out behaviours.
- Gound work for expanding the available ItemActions 2,3,4.
- Added MeleeSDX to allow non-EntityEnemy's target blocks effectively.

</ul>
<p>[ <a class="el" href="namespace_u_a_i.html">UAI</a> Changes ] </p><pre class="fragment">- Added new UAI Task called Guard. This task can replae the Stay action using IdleSDX.
    - Guard is similar to Stay and can be a replacement for Stay.
    - Two new MinEffectActions have been created for this, and is applied by the buff in the SCore's buffs.xml
        - MinEventActionGuardHere : This sets the NPC's guard position to match the player's current position, as well as the direction the player is looking.
        - MinEventActionGuardThere: This sets the NPC's guard position to match where the NPC is currently staying, with the look direction the same.
- Added additional feature for the Wander UAI task:
    &lt;task class="WanderSDX, SCore" interest="Loot:cntBirdnest"/&gt;

    When interest is specified, there is a 30% chance triggering a TileEntity scan matching the value.

    For example, interest="Loot" will search for all Loot containers in the area, and pick one.

    If the TileEntity's entry has a :, that further allows filtering based on block name.

        &lt;task class="WanderSDX, SCore" interest="Loot:cntBirdnest"/&gt; &lt;!-- scan for any loot container that has a block name that starts with cntBirdNest --&gt;


    If interest is not specified, a standard wander is triggered.

- Fixed a bug in AttackTarget where an NPC that was told to stay, would take a few steps out of position to attack
