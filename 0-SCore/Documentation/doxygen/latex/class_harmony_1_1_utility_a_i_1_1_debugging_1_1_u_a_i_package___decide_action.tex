\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This patch replaces the Decide\+Action method with one that will skip targets which are not passed through the package and/or action filters. 

Note that filters are inclusive, not exclusive; and that targets may be filtered by packages and actions, and must pass through both filters.
